[Music] hi guys and welcome to my youtube channel so today we're doing a video on crossroads small and big crossroads this is ted uh we've been driving for about i think about two weeks three weeks nearly yeah yeah probably done about eight eight hours or so think so yeah yeah so um last lesson we worked on big crossroads on dual carriageways turning near side and offside today's lesson we're gonna go over some small crossroads first and then work onto big crossroads just looking at the difference between nearside and offside now do you remember when you would use a near side turn and when you would use an offside then this had to be like a smaller junction and you turned before the traffic yeah and offside probably a bigger one you turn behind the behind the cars behind the traffic yeah so with nearside you you're able to angle yourself sort of 45 and then wait in the middle yeah whereas offside you wait in a straight position,0.0,67.04,941,196,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=0,2 - The driving situation is not critical as it seems like a routine driving lesson with an experienced driver teaching a new driver.
yeah okay so whenever you're ready we're going to get started,68.32,71.36,61,13,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=68,2 - The situation is not critical at all as the car has not moved yet and they are just getting started with the lesson.
just give it a minute and remember to take your blind spot there okay and we're off,87.28,97.6,83,18,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=87,"Critical Level: 2. 

The driving situation is not very critical as the instruction is just to take a moment to remember to check the blind spot before driving off."
okay we're going to take the next road on the left just after the um should i take this on a first gear um one look when we get close to using mirrors though one approach and signal start breaking are there any parked cars on the entrance we can just take it in a second just break enough and turn it in good if it's a narrow entrance or there are parked cars on approach and you can't see into the road then take it in first so turn left in here again so again break as much as you need start turning in try and use pull and push on the steering there so you're not crossing your arms over,117.92,165.12,590,126,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=117,"Critical level: 4 - While there are potential obstacles to be aware of, such as parked cars, the road situation appears to be relatively clear and manageable."
what should we do with that great oh he's turning take the road on the right just there now this one here looks like a tighter entrance so slow down as much as you need yeah now get that clutch up slowly it will help you with the turn thank you and turn with both hands again good try and avoid crossing your arms if you can so does that turn easier now just press ok on the screen to get rid of that message that you will need to fill up fuel at some point think about what's happening with the man we've got lots of hazards on the road this morning straight ahead all right yeah straight up straight ahead from here yeah think about the position you want to be in by the end right and a bit of a fast approach there really carefully really carefully here did you realize you were going to be stopping at the end there um not too right at the end but did you realize you were on the side uh yeah yeah so you can see the hazard line,191.28,272.4,932,193,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=191,"Critical level: 7

The situation is quite critical because there are multiple hazards on the road and the instructor is instructing the learner on how to make a turn and avoid crossing their arms. There is also a warning about needing to fill up fuel and the learner approaching the end of the road with a fast approach."
just where the black car is in the distance in the middle of the road you can see that white line yeah the two yeah so the line just running alongside the same side as us sorry the line running up the road yeah that's your hazard line and then you can see the line going across and the giveaway sign now we are going straight so think about what you want to do first i'm just hoping he'll be parked by the time we get there also keeping an eye on the road ahead as well as the sides is again you can see the road markings ahead looking the same and turn right at the end this time that was a nicer stop than the last one might be slightly overhanging i'm not too sure,275.759,358.4,667,143,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=275,Critical level: 3. The situation is not very critical as the instructor is simply pointing out road markings and discussing the route with the student.
on approach to the large lorry parked ahead ted positions into the middle of the road nice and early giving the vehicle enough clearance you've just got to be careful in case a driver comes back out so we've got to be cautious with large vehicles along these roads as this is a wide road even with parked cars on both sides two cars can pass but you cannot pass with a large vehicle so you would have to give way to buses or make sure that they're giving way for you we want to make sure we maintain a good distance of the vehicle ahead just in case we need to stop for any reason you've got more time is anyone behind us regular mirror attacks have been driving okay so you see the road on the left here we're not turning in but imagine we were turning in there yeah that's quite a narrow entrance so we take something like that in right good clearance from the lorry though hold on okay now with that bus just use the right hand side mirror and,375.84,462.8,946,194,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=375,"I would rate this situation as a 7 because navigating around large vehicles can be dangerous and requires caution, but there are no immediate obstacles or hazards present."
signal you're going to have to cross the center line good but do it slightly earlier next time [Music] because you don't want to get too close on approach to the zebra crossing ahead you need to scan both sides of the crossing as large vehicles may easily hide pedestrians what does this sign here tell us yeah the road narrows oh yeah i passed my food oh yeah yeah oh that's pretty good i got 46. oh that's nice it's really good you only revised what two three weeks was it i did i did do it quite a bit before and then i kind of stopped and then i did it like twice a day for like two weeks before um it's harder to find the place because i in the shopping center so i had i've walked past about three times okay so we're coming up to some crossroads now um i'm gonna get you to try it on your own this time so the traffic lights turn right now looking at the size of the junction which one will it be,464.0,565.76,903,201,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=464,"Critical level: 6. The learner driver is being asked to navigate a crossroads on their own, which requires some level of caution and attention. However, there are traffic lights present which provide some level of guidance and control."
near side or off side um near side okay make sure we don't go in that cycle box thank you,567.92,573.04,89,21,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=567,Critical level: 3 - The situation is relatively non-critical as the driver is simply reminding themselves to stay clear of the cycle box.
oh just next time don't come so far forward yeah because it puts us in a great position but then if somebody ahead wanted to turn yeah we haven't given them any space something okay and then turn left for that black car's just gone in good position a bit closer towards the direction you want to go slow it down a lot more if you want to go fast that's it what about the clutch what are you supposed to do with it okay because the whole point of going down to first gear was to be slow right yeah okay and then take the road on the left just here after these two cars and then lift again,588.839,651.92,587,124,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=588,Critical: 3 - The situation is not too critical as it mainly involves adjusting the position of the car and being aware of the space around other cars.
oh we're definitely in that road aren't we yeah okay you want to be careful with that,672.839,690.0,85,19,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=672,Critical level: 5 - The situation is somewhat critical because the driving instructor is cautioning the driver to be careful about something on the road.
okay now as soon as we've tanned the traffic lights go right into the right hand lane again okay definitely when you stop at a t-junction next time make sure you're behind the giveaway line if we're slightly short of the line there's no harm in that yeah all right so looking at the space in the middle of the junction with nearside you have to only be on the first half of that space yeah so someone else could turn in yeah so the opposite side has space now with that we will be slightly earlier than the point of turn yeah so you have to travel forward and then turn the near side yeah if you're right next to your turning point then you know you're in the wrong position there yeah watch the last one i was too far ahead you were too far ahead yeah had somebody turned up opposite they wouldn't have had any space to actually position if you watch the van he's only on the first half and then he's turned,709.44,763.44,908,191,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=709,Critical level: 7 - This is a critical situation as the driver is providing important instructions for turning at a junction and ensuring proper placement on the road to prevent accidents or collisions with other vehicles.
yeah and even with this one again he's only on the first half it's offside where you'd have to go all the way to the other side and then wait okay and then slowly forward so imagine we had a car opposite us position so that they'd still have space that there yeah yeah and then we just sit there good use the accelerator a bit more just because it's an uphill gradient,765.36,799.04,368,79,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=765,3 - The driving situation is not very critical as the instructor is just giving the learner advice on how to navigate an uphill gradient with a car coming from the opposite side.
think about your position on this road where should it be we're not gonna go past him are we breaking and good so you want to travel a meter from the pavement the whole time so as you're driving just keep an eye on the left hand side here quickly yeah so along the front there you remember that blue marker yeah it'll be just over with the edge of the pavement yeah and then keep it there where should you be here in the road um yeah because you can see the pavement shifted yeah,824.48,863.76,479,99,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=824,"4 - The situation is somewhat critical as the student driver needs to maintain their proper position on the road, but there doesn't appear to be any immediate danger or obstacles in their way."
good position on the road here,903.839,903.839,30,6,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=903,"3 - While a good position on the road is important for safe driving, it is not an extremely critical situation at this moment in the video."
just use your mirrors keep an eye on that guy behind he's not trying to overtake anything but just further to the left we've got tons of space here yeah that's the sort of position you want to stay in throughout is the road's really wide we don't need to be so close to the center all right what we're going to be doing now is at the next set of traffic lights we're going to turn right again will this be um offside well we'll have to see according to the junction yes i know it's a big one yeah most likely then so if the turning for you is quite far ahead then it's more likely to be an offside good now make sure you don't go over that solid lining brilliant all right so you can see your turn is quite far ahead yeah yeah so whereabouts in the junction are you going to go and stop like kind of the middle of it past the middle you see where that yellow bollard is,923.12,999.519,869,193,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=923,"Critical level: 3 - While there may be some slight complexity in the upcoming turn, there is plenty of space and no immediate danger."
ahead yeah we're just going to be just before that so we can be over across towards the bottom but just not overhanging that line so from here we're going to go all the way up to that traffic light so how many cars can position for a near offside okay so go all the way position across and then stop about that yeah there you go as soon as the road's clear we can turn yeah ready okay now the speed on this road did you see the signs no i didn't okay there was a forty sign just as we entered there you'll see another sign just keep looking it's pretty tricky with all the uh trees overgrowing all the signs are hidden and there it is completely hidden should we try foursquare when you get the chance just be careful with this guy because he's probably here for a reason the last lesson we looked at engine braking yeah just make sure when you have to slow down that you try and use a bit of engine braking as well as the foot brake,1001.6,1092.08,933,200,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=1001,"The driving situation is a 2, as there is light traffic and no immediate danger present."
you can see the traffic behind not really that close yeah okay so what should we start doing now then to use a bit of foot break why do we want to use the foot brake just to slow down give us time to do it think about the brake lights at the back oh yeah it's more so to mourn the traffic than anything isn't that good what good do you need to be in now yeah two's okay because it's downhill it'll work just really slowly there so count locked in three as you lift up so we're just going to go ahead from here when we get to the roundabout we're going to turn we're going to turn left it's the first exit when we get to the roundabout yeah we're just going to try a few more of the different near side and offside turns around here good start using that accelerator a bit more just keep it on the vehicle on your right the black one because they're a bit close to that line,1099.44,1175.6,873,193,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=1099,"Criticality: 4 - The traffic is not too close and the situation is manageable, but still requires attention and slowing down."
aren't they we're going left to go where the van is,1176.799,1179.2,51,13,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=1176,2 - The situation is mildly critical as the driver is simply navigating a left turn towards a van.
yeah so on approach to that stop in fourth gear you were already slow so going into third wasn't really an issue with the break it was more just to warn the traffic because your car is really slow yeah clutch down don't worry about it it's okay accelerate and slow clutch it happens all right do we need to signal for fast exit uh yeah yes go into that corner just check the right side as we're leaving why we need to check the right side there cycle cyclists passing on yeah because the two lanes are merging on the exit can we keep going when it's flashing yeah yeah okay okay so why did the engine switch off back there um clutch up yeah i didn't do it three seconds yeah and what about the accelerator did you use that at all uh no i didn't know yeah i couldn't really hear it so you need to find the right balance on the two there it's always that stuff like that now because i know he's going so i think i,1196.24,1271.36,911,193,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=1196,"would rate the driving situation a 5, because there are some potential hazards to be aware of (e.g. cyclists passing, merging lanes), but they are not immediate or urgent concerns."
need to get off quick and then i just stall it yeah now that happens so which lane is going straight yeah check the mirrors now brake on approach that the lights are on and once you're slow enough and then good then get ready so you have to move off faster you can go now after these two of course accelerate and sturdy clutch couldn't hear the accelerator again that time try and get it in early breaking good so right foot again use it and really slow with your left foot turn right just in here checking that right hand side again can we go into that middle space try and fit yourself into that box a bit better breaking and signal again and then in your own time turn yeah it's really important we try and fit into that middle space otherwise you're gonna overhang in the road yeah yeah i think i have a bit about 45 degrees there i think we were okay by the end maybe the tail was very slightly out but the road behind was wide enough then turn left at the end,1272.799,1365.44,965,197,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=1272,"Critical level: 7, there are several moments where the driver needs to be aware of their surroundings, check mirrors, use the correct foot, properly brake, and fit into a space to avoid any accidents."
so you can't see the road marking clearly but you can see that red sign on the left so think about your approach for this so this will have to be nice clutch control because it's a tight turn make sure,1369.919,1389.6,201,43,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=1369,Criticality: 6 - The driving situation is fairly critical as the road markings are unclear and the driver has to rely on alternative cues to make a turn safely.
soon as we turn into a new road use the mirrors what's happened up there uh roadworks roadworks what about the traffic lights uh yeah temporary traffic but they're not working are they okay so it's a bit of a crazy junction they'll slow it right down just cautious here because we're having to go on the wrong side of the road first gear we'll have to wait for the road ahead to be clear we should be able to go in with the vans but keep an eye on the traffic as well because it's not our priority here the traffic lights me i think the man is probably sorting them out soon but um it might it might just be that the reds not working yeah or that they're completely dead i can't tell so the road ahead's clear use your mirror to the right slowly that's it there is a car there but just careful now so we're going to go right at the traffic the roundabout sorry it's a signal on,1407.6,1460.24,877,192,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=1407,"Critical level: 8 - The situation is critical as there are roadworks, temporary traffic lights not working, and a crazy junction where the car has to go on the wrong side of the road. The instructor advises the driver to slow down and be cautious, and keep an eye on the traffic as it's not their priority."
it's really cautious so with temporary lights that are out that are um so the crossing here is blocked off his head wouldn't stop for pedestrians there unless they're already in the road okay take the next road on the right,1461.919,1478.64,223,44,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=1461,"Critical level: 7 - The temporary lights being out and the crossing being blocked off make the situation quite critical, and the instructor's warning about the driver not stopping for pedestrians adds to the severity."
good but with your right hands try and use your right hand first as opposed to taking your left hand across all right was that tone all right or did i turn too early the turning point was fine yeah just with the temporary traffic lights when they're out like that just be really cautious as there's no set priority but because their side of the road is cleared they're bound to just keep coming through just maneuver through it safely using mirrors and eye contact okay so the traffic lights up there we're going to turn right can i go behind that blue check mirrors and signal right if no one's ahead you can move over and then come back in come back in a bit more and sing away provided the road ahead is clear you are allowed to come over and come in if it's not safe you can just wait back there as well all right so nearsider outside um okay but how many vehicles have we got ahead definitely two maybe three mm-hmm yeah i think three okay so,1500.24,1582.88,947,194,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=1500,Critical situation: 3 - Temporary traffic lights being out can make the situation unpredictable and caution is needed to maneuver through it safely.
so if the lights are still green and they happen to get through then we can shuffle forward yeah definitely use the accelerator when you go oh what about the lights so we've made the traffic lights like this only really sort of two cars tend to get through yeah if the road had cleared up earlier then maybe we could have got through oh okay so again think about where you're going to go and wait so again using the bollard head as your guide so the second car shouldn't actually overhang the yellow box should they no so both cars should be on the other side you can see coming in from the other side it's more of a near side he's um yeah that's what i was going to ask is that near side offside because he wasn't more nearside because with their position they're at the angle of the turn is sort of they're coming back in yeah it's not a 90 degree angle so it's a sharper turn for them which is why it's near side,1586.799,1661.12,915,199,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=1586,"2 - The driving situation is not very critical, as they are discussing how to navigate a specific junction and making observations about other vehicles around them, but there is no immediate danger or urgency."
okay ready touchdown accelerate and slow clutch go on try again accelerate turn it all the way it's all right turn it back in quickly and off you go gonna be quicker now you can't be trying to get away with the clutch that fast you're not going to go away your right foot i don't feel like you're using the accelerator ted stalled at the traffic lights because he tried to move away without the accelerator and the clutch was too fast as he recovered quite quickly this didn't really cause any inconvenience to others so this would not be an issue i'm gonna be taking the exit coming off here you can see the signs overhead the two right lanes where do they go um on the motorway right yeah it's blue signs where's the side screen so staying in the far left as you come off good where should your right foot be yeah so you want to be using the brake lights break some more go for the next gear yeah what about the clutch,1685.919,1780.88,920,189,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=1685,"Critical level: 4 - While there are some instructions being given, the driving situation is not overly critical as the driver is making their way off the motorway exit and there are no other cars immediately around them."
clutch up really slow really pull it out slowly we're gonna go left first exit from here all right so are you going to try and use the accelerator okay yeah well so if you want to move off faster how do you do that with the accelerator and what about the clutch leave it keep it still gotta come up in three seconds okay so i've hold the biting point there you go good so build it up to the minimum speed with first yeah and what is the minimum speed um ten twelve about five in first gear so once you've built it up to the minimum speed you can then come off the touch breaking get ready again all right so again it's gonna be the same thing as it goes amber start accelerating and finding the biting point yeah there it is once you've got the minimum you can let go okay we're going to move into the right hand lane when safe so just using mirrors and signal keeping an eye on that white car can you see here in the top yeah yeah and move over you can see,1785.2,1857.76,957,202,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=1785,3 - The driving situation is not very critical as the instructor is guiding the learner driver through a simple lane change and there are no other immediate hazards around.
she's trying to move in here so we need to be in this lane to go the direction we're headed as the left lane goes up on the bridge now okay so we're just going right either of the two lanes behind the bus would have been normal driving and this is the overtaking lane but it's not an issue here because as we go around the lanes merge anyways yeah so if we're on the left lane you're going to be checking right to match and as we're on the right you'll be checking left and right so i'm not talking talking you through the uh moving off part make sure you do it the same as we did before steady clutch you will have to get behind that bus just adjust your speed here oh thank you check the left hand mirror break a little more check the right side and stay as you see that bus coming in try and slow down and use the left okay so it's 30 down here can we overtake the cyclist all right,1860.559,1959.519,885,195,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=1860,"2 - The driving situation is not very critical as there are no immediate hazards or obstacles, but there is a decision to be made regarding overtaking a cyclist."
use your mirrors and get clear of the cyclist leave them lots of space move away over onto the middle you can go over the hatch park and say can't you try not to come back in two suddenly after a cyclist either,1961.679,1973.12,210,44,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=1961,7 - The driving situation is fairly critical because there is a cyclist present and sudden movements from both the car and the cyclist could lead to potential accidents.
okay now at the traffic lights ahead we're going to turn right before moving over what should you do yeah good make sure you keep breaking whilst you're trying to lift up the clutch any concerns with anything we've been done no no so we have a filter arrow for this traffic light don't we yeah moving off is so much better yeah with the filter light at the traffic light junction you can turn straight away as the traffic opposite would not be turning at the same time,1991.36,2044.24,468,93,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=1991,Critical level: 3 - The situation is fairly low-risk as it involves turning right at a filter arrow traffic light junction.
just keep an eye on that left hand side um signals come over to the left more and just slow down your step on your speed come left,2072.159,2078.72,130,28,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=2072,"Criticality: 4, it is somewhat critical as the instructor is giving specific instructions and indicating a need to slow down."

on approach to the zebra crossing ted should have been slowing down preparing to stop as there are pedestrians close to the zebra crossing all right so at the roundabout we're going to turn left so you can see the speed signs oh come on you've seen how you've seen that before you were in two minds now wait wait wait wait first gear let her completely come off now check both sides and then continue okay so we're gonna go left up there,2114.48,2141.76,437,91,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=2114,"Driving situation: 3 - While it's important to slow down for pedestrians at the zebra crossing, the situation does not appear to be excessively dangerous."
okay now as soon as we go left there are three lanes up there yep we're gonna just move straight into the third lane so as we turn we're going straight for the right hand lane this is still a roundabout but it's traffic like halfway and half giveaway so you see the the audi on the inside the convertible yeah that's who we're keeping an eye on the van you can tell he's gonna go out this way yeah maybe that big lorry you might have to wait for him to looking at the lights let's go forward yeah to go in after that lorry is there anyone else okay now looking where you're going and head straight into that overtaking lane we're in this lane because we're turning right at the next set of lights which is coming up quite close,2158.8,2208.4,727,158,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=2158,"6 - The driving situation is quite critical because the student is navigating a roundabout with traffic that is both halfway and half giveaway, and they need to keep an eye on potential hazards, such as the Audi, convertible, the van, and especially the big lorry to ensure they can safely merge into the overtaking lane."
what do we need a signal okay you think about what you want to do a bit more towards the right if you can that's it nicely centered the lane center all right looking at the road marking ahead in the middle yeah you know what you're doing yeah i think so so what side are you turning on it's a bit of a tricky little spot to get into there so i'm not going to do this very fast with this junction you need to position in the second half which is just underneath the bridge making sure that you don't overhang the giveaway line on the other side okay now think about where you want to stop make sure you don't overhang okay again don't worry about the um don't worry don't worry about trying to get into a straight position yeah now when you move from here you're gonna have to do a whole complete turn to the left okay so we can actually go as soon as the road is clear it's quite tricky as our three lanes,2227.04,2298.96,905,195,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=2227,8 - The driving situation is quite critical as the instructor is giving specific instructions for a tricky junction with three lanes and potential overhanging of the giveaway line.
the traffic light present in the junction is not for us as we're waiting at a giveaway line just across the dual carriageway but we can use this if you're unsure when to go yeah i think with them once i always think i need to get straight but really i'll probably don't wait for him wait wait wait do you have to wait something yeah you have to wait until they completely come off no you should you shouldn't keep moving there you should definitely stop them completely all right just keep going slowly here come over back to the left i know the lights are green come over back to the left okay and then move over why do we want to move back to the left just in case they do change yeah because then you don't want to be on the wrong side if they change yeah with pedestrians you have to make sure that they completely come off the crossings yeah so we would be allowed to go once he's halfway if the zebra crossing had an island okay,2302.4,2372.32,934,195,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=2302,2 - The driving situation is not very critical as the speaker is giving advice on how to handle a specific scenario at a junction.
yeah because that's what makes it in the middle yeah in the middle of the road so had that been an island in the middle yeah that would be two separate crossings,2374.96,2380.8,161,33,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=2374,2 - The driving situation is not very critical as the speaker is simply explaining a hypothetical scenario about a road crossing.
okay we're just looking for a place to park if there is one so just be on the lookout here on the left you can pull him behind the silk car slow it right down here here here in this space here braking and move away slightly move away slow it right down slow it right down that's great there thank you secure the car brilliant okay make sure you have put the handbrake on first secure and neutral then switch off the engine okay how's the um practice on crossroads yeah i think the crosswords have been all right to be honest yeah with all of them you sort of knew when you were turning near sadnoxide yeah we positioned properly for all the offside turns which was great for the near side turn you positioned a bit far ahead on the first one yeah so had someone turned up it would have been a bit tricky but yeah yeah yeah the very first one down south feeling yeah that's it yeah um had a bit of trouble with the clutch yeah,2395.92,2452.319,925,194,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=2395,2 - The driving situation is not critical at all as the car is only looking for a parking space.
yeah just needed to add accelerator which i wasn't doing yeah but you saw the difference as soon as you did start to accelerate and slow clutch yeah smooth yeah i think it's because of the noise it makes i think i don't know i feel like well if you can't hear the noise that means you're not accelerating yeah no you did well um just make sure you're definitely finding the biting point and slowly just reaching that minimum which is around five yeah and then you can come off but no you did much better afterwards so yeah i hope you guys find that informative um yeah that's the end of our video you,2453.28,2494.319,600,123,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=2453,3 - The driving situation is not critical at all.

hi guys welcome to my youtube channel my name is aman and this is max max has his driving test coming up in about a week's time just under a week's time yeah um and today we're working on um meeting and clearance and some mini roundabouts so i just want to see how you um driving all and do all these things on your own today okay so if there's any points that you need my help you can just ask but i'm just gonna do it like normal driving where i'll just talk you through it if need be but i am getting you to do all of it on your own at the moment yeah okay so whenever you're ready we'll get started,19.359,49.84,602,136,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=19,2 - The driving situation is not critical at all. It's a routine driving lesson where the instructor is letting the student practice some maneuvers ahead of their upcoming driving test.
so in that case i think they actually wanted to park behind us when you're parking parked up like that don't signal when you're not actually ready to go imagine you had um traffic flowing behind you and you signaled that might actually cause them to slow down and stop for you yep okay so we're working on meeting clearance and some mini roundabouts from here oh that was a bit tight wasn't it it was what did we say about meeting earlier uh sorry clearance how much space do we like around the vehicle like a meter a meter on the sides yeah and in front and behind two two car lengths so you've got that nice oval shape sort of bubble as soon as you feel like your space is being invaded a little bit you have to slow down and consider whether you need to stop yeah there's no kind of squeezing through okay so when we get to that roundabout let's turn right it's the third exit,74.72,146.64,879,183,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=74,"4 - The driving situation is not very critical at this moment. The student and instructor are discussing parking and meeting/clearance distance, and preparing to make a turn at a roundabout."
hmm that was better i thought um if that door had stayed open we would have had a harder time getting through there,168.84,177.84,115,24,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=168,"Criticality: 4 - The situation could have been more critical if the door had stayed open and caused obstruction, but it was still a potential hazard that required caution."
okay take the next road on the left it's just after this white van now we can't see the road,197.28,203.76,92,22,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=197,"6 - While the direction is clear, the inability to fully see the road increases the criticality of the situation."
all right you dealt with that nicely but we were turning in quite wide we were yeah yeah you slowed right down why didn't you start steering earlier um it's good to see more inside the road yeah but you don't want to be in the path either so we still had some space on the left that we could have turned into this road can be tricky with meeting situations as the parking lot so the spaces are limited so they're really sort of looking out in case someone is ahead,222.64,261.28,464,96,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=222,"Critical level: 6 

The situation is moderately critical as the road can be tricky with limited spaces in meetings and the driver needs to be aware of the path and not get into any accidents."
judge of this you are in second gear so change we have got enough space by the way just slowly take your time with it yeah if you're not sure you can reverse good okay now consider how much space there is over here it's good that you stopped for him but he really didn't have any space to get through with you there yeah and then you put yourself in even more trouble i did yeah okay now take the next road on the left it's just opposite the red car on approach to this left turn max slows down well and leans forward while turning as he cannot see into the road consider turning in a bit slower i know you were breaking but once that cart ended maybe you should have gone down to basket so like going into that corner now we're sort of in the middle of the road because of where the parked cars are lean forward and use the reflections on the left good and again the same goes for this next bit is anybody in the reflections on the right hand,294.96,374.8,943,194,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=294,"Criticality rating: 5
The situation is somewhat critical as the driver needs to be cautious while taking the left turn, which is opposite the red car, and lean forward to use reflections to identify any cars coming."
we side quite lucky there you actually get stuck on this road now turn right at that roundabout again thinking about the clearance we've talked about [Music] okay just before that roundabout in terms of clearance the space around your car was okay but i feel like you're still doing things a little too fast how do you no no i agree yeah definitely yeah yeah yeah so as soon as you saw that car had turned up maybe we should have gone down to fast gear and slowed down some more yeah like they're only going to enter once you're out the way right there's no right there's no point of view rushing out the way then,379.759,429.919,613,128,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=379,"I would rate this situation a 6 because there were potential clearance issues and the driver was going too fast, which could have potentially led to a dangerous situation."
can we see anything ahead of this guy should we drop back then again we're traveling at about that two-car gap if he suddenly stops it's harder for you when we get to that round about turn right it's quite a sharp turn this one i thought for a second we're on the crossing but we're not there it's all right just watch that cyclist because he's not going to hold his arm up the whole time now with this roundabout you kind of have to go over the roundabout a little bit okay don't try to go around it completely just the right hand side tires not like that just we had a bit more space than that yeah carry on so the right hand side ties especially the back one will go over it so we're gonna go down some more of the narrow roads around here i need to see you slowing down when you see tighter gaps and especially if someone else turns up don't just push through yeah remember,469.28,542.08,877,187,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=469,"I would rate the driving situation as a 7 out of 10, as the instructor mentions the need to watch out for a cyclist and the sharp turn ahead, and also advises the learner to slow down in tighter gaps and when others turn up."
earlier when we had that black car back in chiswick right at the beginning where the space was there but again you were just nipping through quite quickly so you just need to slow things down yeah the road ahead has parked cars on both sides max approaches slowly positioning on the left in order to give way leaving enough clearance from the vehicle ahead before proceeding take the next road on the left now think about what we've been talking about now,544.32,589.44,455,88,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=544,Criticality: 2 - The situation is not very critical as there are parked cars on both sides and the instructor is guiding the driver on how to approach the situation safely.
so [Music] again don't put yourself on the other side really good position using forward there as well hold on turn left just in here good speed and position there okay well done,616.839,653.2,178,36,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=616,Critical level: 3. The driving situation is not very critical as the instructions are basic and there are no immediate hazards present.
again don't try and prioritize changing gear first slow it down as much as you need and then change gear when you have time okay like with these two guys in the road think about your speed okay because as we're driving through they might just move out into the road again turn left here,692.88,709.76,286,57,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=692,"Critical level: 3. 

While it is important to pay attention to the two guys on the road, the situation does not appear to be extremely urgent as there is no imminent danger."
you can see in the reflection can't you over there look left even though this is traffic on the right you've got to keep an eye on pedestrians on the left if they start crossing because we are on a high street here,725.2,737.76,214,45,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=725,7 - The driving situation is critical because there are pedestrians crossing and the driver needs to keep an eye on them while navigating through traffic.
um okay now at the roundabout we're gonna continue ahead it's the second exit,756.839,762.16,77,17,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=756,"3 - While there are other vehicles on the road, the situation is relatively low-pressure and straightforward with a clear route to follow."
okay can two cars fit in this space yeah they could okay can you fit with um a bus or a lorry no it would not be ideal you would have to stop if they're coming through or they'll stop for you if you're already committed or if the driver ahead is really fast that would also be another reason for you to possibly start okay we're going down again to a few of the narrow streets some of the ones that we've already been on i need you to be really careful with some of the points and maybe consider stopping instead of just pushing through really well done there good so you slowed down and moved left when we get to that roundabout let's turn left [Music] it's good but again i would have personally gone down to first giver for the turn into the yeah oh it's quite tight yeah you got parked cars on both sides yeah what's to say the road is actually clear could have been a car or a motorbike coming through right yeah,784.839,893.68,917,195,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=784,"Critical level: 7 - The driving situation is quite critical as the student needs to be careful on narrow streets and consider stopping instead of pushing through. There are also parked cars on both sides, making it quite tight and potentially dangerous."
now what about that van he's sticking,916.56,916.56,37,8,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=916,"out a bit into our lane, so we need to move over a little to give him more room, but it's not a dangerous situation. 

Critical level: 2 - It's a minor adjustment that needs to be made in response to the van sticking out a bit, but it doesn't pose any immediate danger."
now what about that van he's sticking out yeah where's the driver just be very careful because he might open the door because we had that happen earlier is that van parked the little one or the smaller one yeah we passed it before it's parked okay go right in there oh don't go on the wrong side breaking and just because he's where he is we shouldn't go on the wrong side we're going right from here what's that red car i think you're gonna have to steer much quicker here sorry much earlier yeah someone just moved i've been there on the other road behind us [Music] okay now pull in and park up on the left up there just keep rolling so we're not in the driveway come in a little bit more just use the client front as your guide you're behind the driver right that's pretty good thank you secure the car for a moment good to switch off the engine as well okay how's the drive going so far,916.56,999.04,891,191,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=916,"Critical level: 5. 

The driving situation is somewhat critical due to the possibility of the van's driver opening the door and the need for quick steering, but it is not overly dangerous."
not bad okay so what are the um things we need to work on a little bit more uh definitely the speed um of which i'm approaching some some meeting situations um not so much the meeting situations it's uh yeah you could say for the meeting situation says well actually because earlier with the van on the other road and it's the the clearance as you're turning into a like a small road with parked cars we haven't really had um anyone suddenly turn up but that's how you want to approach it imagine you're turning in and someone suddenly turns up would you be able to deal with that safely yeah and you also want to think about the way we're approaching and if the person behind you would actually have enough time to react as well yeah yeah okay so we're going to try a few more of these roads around here um about five minutes i'm not saying anything and again i want to see you slowing down for those gaps a bit more just don't take any chances,1001.519,1057.76,945,194,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=1001,"Criticality: 5 - The situation is not very critical, but the learner needs to work on approaching meeting situations and turning into small roads with parked cars, especially in scenarios where sudden turns can happen. It is important to slow down and leave enough clearance to ensure safety for themselves and the person behind."
because i know you're not gonna like hit into either of the sides but it just feels too too tight yeah yeah yeah okay so whenever you're ready let's start the car come on there's no harm in that one it happens,1059.919,1081.679,209,46,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=1059,"Critical level: 2.

hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving my name is ammin and today i'm doing a lesson for ted today's lesson we're going to be working on roundabouts now we've already done one of one lesson on roundabouts lesson yeah so we're going to continue with that so we're going to start off with sort of medium roundabouts with two lanes and then we're going to work on to traffic light controlled spiral roundabouts and also giveaway roundabouts with most of it um with the first bit i think i'll probably just let you do that on your own because we worked on that last lesson anyways and then as we go along it'll be a bit of prompting if need be but when we get to the big giveaway roundabout i will probably talk you through that one okay because we haven't done that one today um yeah so whenever you're ready we'll get started always have a full start so whenever you're ready let's drive off,16.48,67.52,896,191,OQOkMzunmQE,1772,https://youtu.be/OQOkMzunmQE?t=16,2 - The driving situation is not very critical as they are starting off with medium roundabouts learned in a previous lesson.
quite a lot of traffic at the moment maybe don't signal what wait until those are because the road's quite big it's not massive if you're on this particular occasion but just look for the right gap so what you want to do is you want to find the right gap in the top mirror and checking in the right mirror every so often and once you've found the right gap looking over your shoulder then signal and move that way you couldn't have missed anything else,75.84,108.079,452,93,OQOkMzunmQE,1772,https://youtu.be/OQOkMzunmQE?t=75,"Critical level: 6

There is quite a lot of traffic which makes the situation more critical, but the road is still quite big and there are no other specific hazards mentioned. It is important to find the right gap before signaling and moving."
okay so the roundabout is just ahead of us at the roundabout i want you to go straight ahead you can see on the signboard that it's signposted for northart okay so looking at the road marking so we don't have a gap good,136.16,158.879,219,51,OQOkMzunmQE,1772,https://youtu.be/OQOkMzunmQE?t=136,"Critical rating: 5 - While it is important to correctly navigate a roundabout, the situation is not extremely dangerous or complicated.

can we use third gear on this road yeah yeah why is that get better than second at 20. uh it's just smoother yeah and it's also more fuel efficient isn't it yeah yeah that's the main reason there if this road had parked cars throughout then you probably want to stay in second gear for more control yeah are they completely overspeed though okay i want you to take the next road on the right again think about what you need to do on approach and just remember you are in third gear at the moment on approach to this right turn ted turns before the trunk as there is enough time to turn without slowing down the vehicle okay very nice if that lorry had been approaching faster we would have waited right yeah on approach to the bins ted positions on the left hand side leaving enough space through the middle of the road for any oncoming vehicles,201.2,276.24,845,170,OQOkMzunmQE,1772,https://youtu.be/OQOkMzunmQE?t=201,Criticality: 3 - The driving situation is not very critical as the road seems clear and there are no immediate obstacles or hazards. The instructor is simply providing advice on gear selection and positioning on the road.
okay so we're gonna go back to that round about we just did earlier this time i want you to turn right third exit so think about when you signal right and at what point you would change your signal,294.32,308.84,197,41,OQOkMzunmQE,1772,https://youtu.be/OQOkMzunmQE?t=294,"Critical level: 3. This situation is moderately critical because it involves navigating a roundabout and switching lanes, but does not involve any immediate danger or complex maneuvers."
good i'm glad you were still looking both ways there everyone keeps overtaking on this video no no no that's so slow though on this yeah i know it's just it is what it is we just brought down the speed limit everywhere okay so on the next sign board we're going to follow signs to rice lip now there's a solid line in the middle the car behind shouldn't overtake,325.36,357.44,362,79,OQOkMzunmQE,1772,https://youtu.be/OQOkMzunmQE?t=325,"Criticality: 4 - There seems to be some traffic and speed issues, but the situation doesn't currently pose a significant danger."
okay really nice approach there good but i want you to start using that mirror before you signal what should we do with the bus check right yeah okay should we turn that off okay there's two lanes just stay on the left one they both go the same way so on that last roundabout why do we need to use the mirror before we signal then uh just because it could be coming past or yeah in case someone's trying to pass on your left right yeah now on that last roundabout there isn't really enough space for two lanes but usually that's where you'd have two lanes yeah and we would want to be on the outer lane at that point yeah so that's why that mirror check is more important just be careful of it at this point ahead there was a collision on the opposite side of the road with scenarios like this you have to be really cautious and use clutch control the traffic in the right-hand lane all had to move back into the left-hand lane as the traffic,397.68,473.919,942,195,OQOkMzunmQE,1772,https://youtu.be/OQOkMzunmQE?t=397,"Critical level: 8

on the opposite side of the road was using the middle of the road to avoid the collision throughout this section of road ted uses slow clutch control watching the traffic in the right hand lane as they had to keep moving back to the left in traffic like this you have to drive really carefully as there are various hazards that others may not be able to see like the motorbike that emerges from the left-hand side and the pedestrian that's standing in the right-hand lane that the vehicles on the right are trying to avoid all right so we're now coming up to our traffic light controlled spiral roundabout we did have a few attempts on this last time so what i'll do is i'll probably prompt you through it if need be so this is the one where you have to start again according to where your exit is sort of laid out on the diagram and then be really particular about what lane you're going into and following your lane if we end up going the wrong way is that okay uh,476.08,543.68,966,195,OQOkMzunmQE,1772,https://youtu.be/OQOkMzunmQE?t=476,"5 - The traffic situation is fairly critical with various hazards to navigate, but the instructor will provide guidance for the upcoming traffic light controlled spiral roundabout."

so on the next roundabout it's the one without traffic lights and it can be quite scary because the traffic on the right will be coming in fast so there's a few things here so the first thing is making sure that you're starting in the correct position and then following your lane and then using the mirrors in the roundabout all important the left one yeah so when we go on to this roundabout we're going to be going straight so that will usually mean start on the left but as we go forward the left splits and we have to be in the middle once we set off into the roundabout from the middle lane you've got to go in and across towards the left and what mirror do we have to check there left left and it's again because that person in the left lane who's meant to be turning sometimes goes ahead so that's why that left mirror check is so important if they happen to be there you just want to step off and sort of deal with them,1118.0,1165.12,928,196,OQOkMzunmQE,1772,https://youtu.be/OQOkMzunmQE?t=1118,"7 - The driving situation is quite critical as the roundabout is without traffic lights and there is traffic coming in fast from the right, making it important to start in the correct position, follow the correct lane, and use the mirrors properly to avoid any potential collision with other drivers."
safely so if they're behind you you'd speed up but if they're sort of level with you just slow down but don't move right cool okay yeah provided you're not waiting too long nobody really does that yeah it's only if you sit there for ages and age and don't get impatient behind but they'll do it yeah cool the second thing is the gap that we're looking for now as you know with the the other roundabouts we were on when you're looking you want somebody to take your exit so if there's somebody on the roundabout leaving towards our exit then we can enter now how would you know if someone's leaving towards the right in the left-hand lane they'll be on the outskirts wouldn't they yeah and their signal would be on so firstly just watch for that position make sure it's really on the outskirts and then look out for a signal if it's just like the single car leaving as we're entering we're crossing through,1166.72,1213.2,905,193,OQOkMzunmQE,1772,https://youtu.be/OQOkMzunmQE?t=1166,Criticality: 6 - It's important to be aware of the gap and ensure that someone is not exiting towards our intended exit before entering the roundabout.
lanes it may not be an ideal gap you might see traffic around you move but may not necessarily be safe for you so don't go just because others are going yeah yeah and lastly when we go in it is really important that you speed up so on this roundabout when you know when you normally move off you sort of move off in first you get to about 10 12 and you change we're not going to change at 10 12 we're going to change later of course why would we want to change gears later um straight into third movie no no no we don't want to lose too much power if we do think about why you would want to accelerate more in first gear just so you're already moving at a quicker speed that's it so you can pick up speed quicker because lower gears have more power so when we move off from there you're going to be looking ahead and across once you've found the right gap you have to balance and really sort of go for it,1214.96,1258.799,904,200,OQOkMzunmQE,1772,https://youtu.be/OQOkMzunmQE?t=1214,"I would rate the driving situation as a 6, as the instructor is discussing the importance of finding a safe gap and balancing when moving onto the roundabout, which requires some caution and attention."
and accelerate a lot harder yeah so we're going to change gear around 15 to 17 as opposed to 10 12. yeah so we're going to hold off a little bit okay the car will be quite loud with that one yeah okay um so yeah first we're going to just go ahead when we get to the other side we're going to do a u-turn and we're going to do that a few times but i will be talking you through that of course so when you're ready let's start so again think about when you're going to signal for the move off it's good,1260.559,1294.0,500,121,OQOkMzunmQE,1772,https://youtu.be/OQOkMzunmQE?t=1260,2 - The driving situation is not critical as they are just practicing a u-turn in a controlled environment.

alexa maintains a slow speed throughout the busy high street as there are various hazards and people crossing the road the road narrows down in the distance so alexis slows down and keeps more to the left to allow space for the vehicles in front to pass through the middle of the road,831.839,856.0,284,56,UE7TtEZXq8I,2098,https://youtu.be/UE7TtEZXq8I?t=831,"Criticality: 7 - The situation is quite critical as there are multiple hazards and pedestrians crossing the road, and the road is narrowing down.

around about 10 left the junction has an open view so alexa looks in advance and carries on without hesitating there are two lanes on approach to the roundabout the roundabout is a flat painted circle but there is not enough space for two links to flow easily alexa encroaches onto the left hand lane as she goes into the roundabout she should have gone over the painted circle a little bit to avoid cutting into the left hand lane as this would have been a serious fault had a vehicle been next to her and the traffic lights were turning white on approach to the traffic light junction both of the right hand lanes turn right again being in the right hand lane here is not a concern provided she turns into the right hand lane and then moves back into the left when safe,892.0,969.6,771,155,UE7TtEZXq8I,2098,https://youtu.be/UE7TtEZXq8I?t=892,"Critical Level 5 - While there are some potential hazards like the narrow lane and encroaching into the left lane, the situation is not overly critical as Alexa is able to proceed without incident."
once in the new road alexa makes good progress and gets up to the speed of the road she should try and move back into the far left hand lane as that's the normal driving lane and she's currently in the overtaking lane as alexa is actively looking in her mirrors and trying to get back towards the left-hand lane this is not a serious fault whilst using her mirrors alexa should have signaled here as the vehicles behind don't realize she's trying to get back into the left-hand lane staying in the overtaking lane not moving back into the left-hand lane can easily result in a serious fault in the test if a vehicle overtakes you on the left-hand lane and then moves back in front of you this would definitely go down as a serious fault for position normal driving alexa leans forward to use her mirrors to change lanes causing the car to shift quite suddenly at high speeds resulting in a steering fault alexa approaches the traffic light turn a bit too fast,987.12,1097.36,959,193,UE7TtEZXq8I,2098,https://youtu.be/UE7TtEZXq8I?t=987,"7 - The driving situation is quite critical as failing to indicate and remaining in the overtaking lane can result in serious faults during tests, and shifting suddenly during high speeds can result in steering faults."
she needs to try to get her vehicle in the central reservation and she also goes over the road marking for the road ahead at this junction there is no repeat traffic light ahead to know when it's safe to turn right the red vehicle ahead completely blocks the view of the road ahead blocking all three lanes as alexa cannot see the road ahead it's not safe for her to edge forward as there could very easily be a motorbike hidden behind this vehicle when the traffic in front looks like they've stopped alexa should have looked at the traffic on the right hand side where the white car is when the white car starts moving then it's safe to proceed but alexa continues to wait,1098.88,1144.16,674,135,UE7TtEZXq8I,2098,https://youtu.be/UE7TtEZXq8I?t=1098,"Critical level: 9.

watch how the vehicle ahead stops to give way as they leave very little clearance from the parked car on the left now that's an example of what you do not want to do to pass a parked vehicle,884.639,893.44,190,40,KIMxnX6X9AM,2079,https://youtu.be/KIMxnX6X9AM?t=884,"Critical level: 7.

once in the new road naomi makes good progress to get up to the speed of the road she's using her mirrors but does not signal to change lanes the vehicles behind her don't realize she's trying to change lanes naomi continues to pick up speed trying to change lanes and then goes too fast for the speed of the road resulting in a serious fall of use of speed,992.56,1022.839,357,75,KIMxnX6X9AM,2079,https://youtu.be/KIMxnX6X9AM?t=992,"Criticality: 8 - Naomi's actions could potentially lead to an accident, as she is not signaling her intention to change lanes and is also going too fast for the speed of the road."

that's great thank you can you just give me a few minutes try to extract yes please switch off the engine okay how would you say you didn't know me very poorly yeah very very poorly i think from from the moment i had to reverse when i basically caught loads of traffic i just completely just set me off and then from then on i was just bad thing after bad thing sorry i don't mean to be laughing but i know it's true though um you know it wouldn't be a pass on this occasion there's quite a few quite a few things there now i'm going to be quite strict with some of the faults now because there's no point in me being lenient no because then you'll take it too lightly so that scenario where you had to reverse did we have priority i mean i think we would have done what side of the road were the parked cars they were on our side so they have priorities and then you sort of stopped in the road you didn't,1630.159,1692.64,906,195,KIMxnX6X9AM,2079,https://youtu.be/KIMxnX6X9AM?t=1630,"rate: 8 - The driving situation is quite critical as the learner driver struggled with reversing and caught loads of traffic, making multiple mistakes that could have caused accidents."
really get out of his path yeah and then he wasn't having it he couldn't get through yeah so you you've had to reverse now it was okay up until that point the meeting situation was a bit of a minor fault at that point yeah you could have dealt with it yeah now as soon as you put it in reverse gear you sort of looked over to the left and at the back of the car and just carried on reversing yeah there was a postie on the right who stepped out right behind you and crossed the road okay so that gave you a serious fight on observation you've not looked over your right shoulder okay yeah so that was the first one and then it took you quite a while before you managed to sort of get out of the way and then eventually like you saw loads of traffic yeah that sort of accumulated by that point so it would have been um sort of a serious thought on meeting there yeah of course yeah so i've got a serious thought on meeting serious on moving off,1693.919,1740.48,943,198,KIMxnX6X9AM,2079,https://youtu.be/KIMxnX6X9AM?t=1693,"Serious: 8.

there was a lot of funny steering it wasn't yeah yeah so you're getting quite nervous in that lane yeah so just that all could have been avoided because um at those traffic lights to turn right there were two lanes yeah you went for the overtaking i think it's because there was someone next to me yeah there was someone else next to me so i kind of assumed that they would go either in the middle or the left lane so i kind of just did not i mean at the traffic lights before beginning the right turn there were two lanes okay so you should have gone in the first one to make that left turn naturally okay yeah sorry right turn but in the left lane yeah yeah okay um then i was going to get you to do parking on the right and reversing yeah what happened that was because there were people coming in front well then what should you have done if you know you were indicated sooner i should have just well the van was quite far,1796.0,1845.76,926,189,KIMxnX6X9AM,2079,https://youtu.be/KIMxnX6X9AM?t=1796,"3 - The driving situation is mildly critical because there were some errors in lane choice and steering, but it could have been avoided with better observation and judgement."
initially when you wanted to park up so you could have gone across and just stopped but if you know you have to wait for him yeah isn't it safer to just stop in the middle of the road yeah and then just let the van through and then move across the road yeah just like you would for a right turn yeah of course there's traffic behind but then i didn't say anything and where did you go and stop in the bathtub in the bus stop i was thinking what is this girl doing and then i couldn't have you going any further because then there was a junction and i didn't want you reversing in that position it was just no good so again you've got a dangerous fault for response to road markings okay it's the bus stop yeah you shouldn't be stopping no yeah of course i was like oh no it was like worst case scenario everything was happening yep um then you had this maneuver here this happened with this because i thought i was going to hit the front of that car,1847.2,1895.76,949,200,KIMxnX6X9AM,2079,https://youtu.be/KIMxnX6X9AM?t=1847,"Critical situation: 8 - The situation became critical when the driver stopped in the bus stop, which is a dangerous fault, and could have led to an accident especially with traffic behind them.

okay now you know for this uh maneuver you have i said oh my god i said it at the beginning i was like yeah park within two and i'm thinking what on earth are you doing why i don't know why you made your life so much i think it's because i basically i went really far away from the card stock yep that too so i was like okay well i'll take it at a bigger angle which was very very good i should have just reversed back a slightly more and then done it normally now even with this maneuver your observation was lacking yeah when you went close to the back and your back tire attached yeah you didn't look behind you just come out okay the second time you did look behind and you saw the mini but you still went back out yeah i thought it was stopping but yeah but she wasn't right so i had to nearly break at that point as well yeah so you've got a serious and a dangerous fault both on observation yeah i think with your meeting,1896.32,1943.039,928,198,KIMxnX6X9AM,2079,https://youtu.be/KIMxnX6X9AM?t=1896,"Critical level: 9.

situations what kept happening was when you were meeting traffic you weren't giving away well enough in advance okay and then when you were going through and giving way you're still in the road as opposed to out of their path okay so even two other meeting situations we had later the cars in front had to squeeze through next to you as opposed to just having that space yeah so i think we need to go and work on some meeting situations yeah we do have and then um yeah i think meeting situations that would avoid that serious fault there and then that one there the use of speed making sure that you're just moving back to the left when safe but don't make it like the one and only thing that that's what you've got to do it was okay for you to stay in that lane if you can't move over yeah but don't go over speed okay okay um oh back there there was a right turn at that junction it was on a weird sort of,1944.64,1995.519,908,192,KIMxnX6X9AM,2079,https://youtu.be/KIMxnX6X9AM?t=1944,"8 - The driving situation is quite critical as the student is repeatedly not giving way properly during meeting traffic situations, which could lead to serious accidents."

okay i'm going to turn that off now so i hope you guys found that video useful and we're going to go address some of these concerns now and by the this time next week you'll have your license don't worry i know i know it seems like far-fetched at the minute but no you're not that far off okay okay because you've got to go through this where you think oh you know what i've made so many mistakes and then for next time you won't have the same errors because now you've moved from them [Music],2046.64,2074.55,493,111,KIMxnX6X9AM,2079,https://youtu.be/KIMxnX6X9AM?t=2046,0 - The situation is not critical at all.

hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving my name is erman and today i'm doing a lesson with sami now sammy hopefully has a test coming up hopefully in about like two three weeks time today's lesson we're going to be working on roundabouts dual carriageways and slip roads i just want to see how he does everything on his own so near enough like a mock test we're just going to do a mixture of turns all the roundabouts you've been practicing okay so yeah whenever you're ready let's get started so i'm just going to give you instructions as normal okay so whenever i need you to turn to move off turn left at the end here [Music] all right relax just normal driving okay [Music] what's the speed down here sammy okay now the roundabout i'd like you to follow the road ahead it's the second exit on approach to this roundabout sammy approaches from the right hand lane and,15.44,107.92,876,192,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=15,"I would rate the driving situation at a 7, as they are going to be practicing on roundabouts, dual carriageways, and slip roads, which require advanced driving skills."
then moves into the middle lane to follow the road ahead the ideal lane to go straight would have been the far left lane behind the blue van as it's easier to take the exit [Music] as he enters the roundabout he realizes he needs to change lane so he uses his mirrors towards the left and switches down to the left when safe and exits the roundabout,109.68,134.48,349,73,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=109,Critical level: 4 - Changing lanes in a roundabout can be moderately critical as there is potential for confusion and risk of collision if not executed properly.
[Music] okay now when we get back to greenfield roundabout i'd like you to turn right it's the third exit at this next roundabout the main exits are left and right which leads onto an a road onto a dual carriageway the middle and the right hand lane both turn right third exit it's easier to be in the middle lane because it naturally spirals down to become the left lane to exit,150.9,177.44,379,85,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=150,"Critical level: 6 - The situation is relatively critical as turning onto a dual carriageway requires attention and proper lane positioning, but it is not overly dangerous if done correctly."
as the middle lane goes straight and right sammy should have been signaling right to make it clear that he's taking the third exit,193.84,199.44,130,26,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=193,"Criticality: 6 - While not a life-threatening situation, signaling properly is important for the safety and awareness of other drivers on the road."
[Music] when sammy notices a second exit is directly ahead he should have used his mirrors and spiraled down towards the left he does do this but he moves over a bit late this could be an issue if somebody turns up in the left hand lane before him on this slip road sammy makes good progress to join the dual carriageway he leans forward using his right hand mirror to make sure that it's safe to join there's a silver car approaching quite fast and not adjusting their speed so simony stays on the slip road a bit longer to make sure it's safe to join that guy's driving really well yeah you don't want that nicely just on that roundabout we needed a right signal uh from the start yeah yeah yeah and then um when you were you were in the correct position to begin with okay but then when your exit was next yeah you didn't move down you should have moved yeah but you did eventually but you could have moved,218.92,295.52,909,192,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=218,"Critical level: 5. There is potential for danger if someone turns up in the left lane before Sammy, but he does make good progress and checks his mirrors before joining the dual carriageway. However, there is room for improvement when it comes to signaling and lane position on the roundabout."
over a little earlier yeah okay now at the roundabout i'd like you to take the full exit right,297.12,304.479,94,21,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=297,"Critical Level: 6 

The situation is moderately critical as the driver is approaching a roundabout, which can be a potentially dangerous area due to the unpredictability of other drivers."
as we came off the dual carriage rate onto the slip road sami uses good engine braking and foot brake to make sure that he slows down in good time for the roundabout,323.12,330.8,165,35,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=323,Critical level: 3 - Sami's actions show good driving habits but the situation is not particularly critical as there are no immediate hazards present.
i'm glad you didn't stop at those lights because this lady behind us she also came through you ready sammy moves off at the traffic lights he uses his mirrors towards the left to move away from the roundabout towards his exit,351.84,371.44,225,46,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=351,"4 - The situation is slightly critical because there is another driver behind them, but it doesn't seem like an immediate danger."
roundabout was really nicely done at the end when we get to the roundabout we're gonna go straight ahead second exit okay the slip rope at the end is actually a giveaway junction so you're more likely to stop than to merge straight away sami should have been signaling right so the vehicles on the right know that he's about to come in sami does lean forward and use his mirror on the right to make sure it's clear but there was a vehicle approaching and he misjudges their speed so i had to break no no you should you shouldn't go in you shouldn't go into that okay okay it's not a slip road is it no okay take your time just lilly behind's a bit closer do that in mind okay lean forward as much as you can on that one once you're ready accelerate quite a bit and then get going yeah good don't worry about the lady behind me hold it there thank you we'll talk about it later,434.24,498.479,876,191,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=434,"Critical level: 7.

all right now if you can pull over and park on the left just ahead of the silver car okay yeah just ahead of them okay move away slightly remember we don't want to park really close here that's great thank you to kill the car for a moment i think switch it off okay so what happened there why did i have to stop you because that car was just too close and um yeah i should have stopped yeah so you were leaning forward and so you can see the white car coming yeah yeah that's not a slip road is it no plus even if it was he was too fast okay yeah so coming up to that we had giveaway lines giveaway sign and a triangle on the floor so most likely you're going to stop there and the other thing was when we're coming up to that we're coming as if it's a slick road what should you have been signaling oh right right because they can't see your lift signal can they no because it's not is that not exactly,532.959,593.839,903,195,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=532,"Critical level: 5 - Although it was necessary to stop the car to discuss the situation, the overall driving situation was not extremely critical as it did not involve any immediate danger or risk of accident."
a t-junction where you're right yeah okay so your right signal should have been flashing to get their attention and then yeah the white car was too fast we should have been stopping there okay and then the lady behind she went right up close to you on the gradient which made it a bit harder but just make sure you sort of lean forward keep looking for the right gap and then accelerate and then bite go for it quickly okay okay all right the roundabout was really good you could see your lane was slightly obstructed from the the large vehicle on the first yeah yeah we don't want to go around him because that will put you out of your lane into there so you waited good whenever you're ready so what's the speed on this road so we need a very big gap think about what else we need to do before moving thank you good where else did you look at the end good there should always be a final check over into that corner yeah on this slip road we have our own length,596.0,667.839,962,198,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=596,"7 - The situation is fairly critical as there were multiple factors to consider at the T-junction and it required quick thinking and decision making, but the roundabout was handled well."
as we merge onto the dual character so you don't need to signal or use your mirrors to move over,669.839,673.92,96,21,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=669,"Critical level: 7 - Although it is not required to signal or use mirrors when merging onto a dual carriageway, there is still a high level of risk involved when maneuvering onto a busy road."

okay once we're off on the roundabout i'd like you to turn right that exit okay so sami prepares his feet really well as he notices his gap approaching as sammy sees the second exit directly ahead he starts using his mirrors towards the left to move down into the left hand lane to take the exit,714.72,763.279,295,62,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=714,7 - The driving situation is relatively critical because the student is approaching a roundabout and needs to properly navigate and change lanes to take the correct exit.

keep looking left as well because you'll see what they're slowing down for now they might give way to you good so the crossing is quite useful there all right i want you to follow some signs now for a little while uh follow signs to heathrow,808.8,822.639,241,51,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=808,2 - The driving situation is not very critical as the learner is just following signs and there is no immediate danger or obstacle.
someone's put the flag on me aaron try not to follow it so close because the lanes merge anyways okay so what should we do as we exit that check the right side a bit yeah yeah check the right side and then you can just move over right yeah okay so we're still following signs to heathrow okay on approach to the stop at the traffic lights sami should have braked firmer to stop before the stop line i didn't break as there were no pedestrians waiting to cross where have you stopped in the okay yeah i should have slowed down a bit sooner you should have stepped off the accelerator briefly on approach but once you got too close you've got to just carry on okay and when you committed to that stop you should have really just braked a bit further okay okay yeah all right we'll talk about later heathrow is the third exit on the roundabout the right hand lane splits into two and both lanes go towards heathrow,849.279,926.16,911,192,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=849,"5 - The driving situation is moderately critical as they are approaching a traffic light and discussing the need for firmer braking, but there are no immediate dangers present."
sami uses the first lane and this will be the left lane on the exit sami follows the roundabout really well but should use the left hand mirror as he enters as sometimes vehicles from the left may straight line the roundabout,926.959,944.959,225,46,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=926,"Critical rating: 4.

all right your position was really nice the whole time just a few mirror checks missing okay as we entered what mirror should we check uh left outside by the left side just because we're moving down yeah we're moving across aren't we even though is your lane you're moving across yeah and sometimes somebody in the left lane may straight line it yeah yeah which is more of a safety check and plus when we exit before that mirror before that signal came in the left signal okay mirror check there isn't so we've got another one for heathrow on this next roundabout slimeboard slightly hidden straight to follow the road ahead all three lanes go ahead the left lane is ideal as sami observes to the right his position gets too close to the center line he should have been looking back and forth to stay in the center of his lane [Music],961.279,1046.95,834,168,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=961,"Critical level: 3 - While there were some mirror checks missing, the situation is not extremely critical as the learner's position was good and they were aware of the importance of mirror checks."
all right roundabout position y is really good on approach instead of sort of looking for on the right like that glance back and forth okay so look right look ahead so that your position is is really sort of in the center of your lane okay and yeah there was a gap at the very beginning your wrist but there's no harm done you took the next gap straight away all right no more signs to heathrow i'd like you to take the exit coming off here okay at the roundabout i'd like you to turn right it's the third exit towards hillingham on approach to the roundabout the right hand lane splits into two both middle and right lane both turn right again the middle lane is ideal for turning right as it leaves onto the left hand lane on the exit as sami enters the roundabout he should have stayed on the second lane from the right as the first two lanes are just for heathrow second exit as he's using his mirrors really well,1063.039,1141.679,917,194,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=1063,"Critical level: 3.

okay just move into the right-hand lane something all right yes please okay so on that particular round that there was a lot of uh lane changes going on yeah okay we'll talk about it in just a minute we're gonna go right at those traffic lights okay whenever you come up to green lights that have been green for a while just take a foot off the accelerator on approach if they don't change carry on and if they do change then you have time to stop there is a point with every traffic light obviously where you've got to just make a decision yeah yeah as long as you've taken your foot off the accelerator on approach you've still given yourself time in case they do change yeah okay so on that roundabout you started in the correct position as you went into the roundabout you said okay i'm taking the third exit yeah the the lanes divided there was one on the left one on the right and then as they went forward they divided again into from two to four,1162.84,1233.12,953,194,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=1162,"Critical level 5 - There are multiple lane changes happening but the instructor gives helpful advice for approaching traffic lights, making the situation slightly more manageable."
so the first two were actually going heathrow which it said on the floor okay and we should have been in the third one there okay and then from there you started using your mirrors to move left and you were also checking the right which is good but why didn't you commit to the far left like uh i don't know i just thought it was too much to move over okay we had loads of time you were checking for ages there was nobody behind okay if you know you're leaving just try and get the cross fully yeah makes your life easier on the exit yeah,1235.76,1262.159,538,114,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=1235,"Criticality: 4 - Not critical at all.

Explanation: The situation described is a common driving mistake, and while it could have made the exit slightly more difficult, it was not a dangerous situation."
was that a single or a double crossing a double so i didn't need to wait you didn't need to wait for her to come completely on provided she's in the middle and carrying on we can okay,1284.88,1294.24,183,41,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=1284,Critical level: 2 - The situation is not critical since the speaker is discussing a previously encountered scenario and providing guidance on how to handle it.
can you see the exit is a really thin little line as opposed to the other two which are quite thick line there to follow the road ahead you have to be in the middle lane now watch as the vehicle in the left lane goes ahead this is why it's really important to use the left hand mirror as you go forward into a roundabout it's all right don't worry about it sammy has to wait a little while before he can enter at this roundabout as their gaps were limited as we're crossing a dual carriageway the vehicles approaching from the right are approaching fairly fast come on steady let's go go across to the island okay,1314.64,1366.96,613,130,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=1314,7 - The situation is critical because they are crossing a dual carriageway and the vehicles approaching from the right are approaching fairly fast. The driver needs to be steady and careful while crossing to the island.
we're just going to repeat that roundabout again okay okay [Music] from the right in the round about there there wasn't a lot of traffic move to the left one safe just turn that indicator off so the red car doesn't think you're turning in okay now we're going ahead okay same position as before as you're looking around if it's only one lane you're crossing because there's only one car can you take it yeah no not so much but earlier there was um only one car yeah every so often provided you cross them nicely you can take it he's a bit faster yeah when we had them in the outside lane it was easier because they have to do a much bigger turn to get past you whereas the ones on the far right lane they tend to straight line it a bit quicker don't they yeah you don't want to move just because he's blocking your view there yeah okay now really quickly go for it that's it good and then,1385.919,1462.08,888,192,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=1385,"I would rate this situation as a 3 because there is only one car and not a lot of traffic, making it a relatively safe and low-pressure situation."
really good position hold on yeah a little bit cautious with the gaps there but yeah it's better than being a bit pushy and getting through because you can see the guy next to you waited just about the same didn't he thank you secure the car switch off okay so i'm just going to talk about the key points where we could improve a little bit because most of it was really good so firstly let's talk about you can open the window if you want okay yeah so let's talk about that slip road sort of kensington slip road it's it looks like a slip road but it's actually a junction yeah so you kind of try to go before that white car right yeah yeah yeah okay so you understand why i had to stop you there definitely yeah yeah so yeah you needed to be approaching that he needed to be quite far in order for you to really make that gap now the lady behind she was right up close i think she probably wanted to take it but that's not necessarily what you want to,1468.0,1520.559,953,202,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=1468,"Critical level: 6 

While the situation may not have been immediately dangerous, attempting to make a gap before a junction could have resulted in a potential collision had the instructor not intervened."
do okay so you want to make sure it's a nice safe gap before we move in there honestly i would have just stopped even if they're a little bit further and i'm not sure i would have still stopped there because it is a junction not a slip road even if it was a slip road you want to slow down let them through if they're at that speed and then move in behind them and then speed up again okay and then we had what other roundabout could we improve on oh um white hot roundabout when we took the exit for heathrow that left mirror check why does that need to be what does that mirror need to check if there's someone someone there yeah so it's still your lane isn't it but it's just in case somebody is pushing through thinking it's their lane straight line in the roundabout okay um then we had aussie garden roundabout where we were taking right turn third exit and your sort of lanes were all over the place in that one yeah,1521.84,1574.159,923,199,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=1521,"6 - The situation is fairly critical as the instructor is pointing out several mistakes that could have consequences, like not ensuring a safe gap before moving in, or not checking the left mirror before taking an exit on a roundabout. However, there is no immediate danger."
yeah yeah so if we had more traffic around us you would have found that trickier yeah the good thing on that particular roundabout was you were using your mirrors so it wasn't concerned that you'd move in front of someone because you were checking to make sure it was safe but we did get into the wrong lane so when we first started you're in the correct position as you went in you should have gone round and noticed that okay well i'm taking the third and the first is just gone so the first lane on the left was to the second exit and then as we went forward that divided into two and then you were on the right there so we shouldn't have been on that first half at all we should have been the second half it was marked but it was slightly faded so that's probably why you didn't notice yeah yeah yeah and then from there when you know you're definitely leaving try and get all the way left okay yeah yeah all right,1576.72,1620.72,918,191,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=1576,"I would rate the driving situation as 6, as the student driver made a mistake and entered the incorrect lane, but the traffic was moderate and they were using their mirrors properly."
and let's talk a little bit about the hesitation on this last roundabout so firstly you stalled when you tried to move off yeah why did it switch off i i just didn't accelerate enough yes and also the clutch it was just completely off so you have to accelerate on that one yeah and then the clutch has to be steady on the lighting point yeah to get that position um into the roundabout the entry and the hesitation it wasn't that bad because a guy next to you also just sat there a little while but there were a few gaps that we could have taken like the one before the green car i think yeah so you know we're crossing three lanes there now in busier traffic you need to make sure all three lanes are clear because you're crossing all three together but at the moment we sort of had what somebody in the first lane somebody in the middle lane and somebody in the top lane now we're going to cross the first lane fairly quickly aren't we so if somebody's in the first lane,1621.279,1670.64,972,201,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=1621,"Critical level: 4 - While there were a few gaps that could have been taken, the hesitation and entry into the roundabout wasn't that bad, but caution is still needed as we were crossing three lanes."
and they're only just about to start we can probably take it yeah a lot quicker can we whereas if someone's in the middle or the top plane we're going to cross their pass path sort of last and they'll be a lot closer to you so that's the gap that we don't want to take yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but yeah overall really good just some of the key points that we need to improve on we'll prob we'll go work on that now but i'm not majorly concerned because we have plenty of time to fix that so yeah so i hope you guys found that video useful and uh don't make some of the mistakes that sammy did but it's all right it's all a learning curve you,1672.0,1711.36,641,146,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=1672,"wouldn't want to be in a hurry, but the driving situation is not critical at all (0) as they are just discussing a scenario and not actively driving."

you can pull it in park up on the lift don't worry about the drives just in this space here is fine that's great though thank you okay bro what i'd like you to do now using the vehicle in front i'd like you to carry out the parallel park exercise so pull over alongside this vehicle in the road then reverse back and park within two car spaces please [Music],1479.84,1508.18,358,77,2iDsolygkKk,2041,https://youtu.be/2iDsolygkKk?t=1479,"Critical Level: 4 - The situation is somewhat critical as the learner driver is about to perform a parallel park, which can be challenging, but there is no immediate danger or urgency."

[Music] just give me a few minutes all right okay how was the drive for you bro uh okay like what did you say sorry i'm rocky like oh rocky yeah then all right then at the end just a little bit okay now you're not familiar with this area at all it's very new to you and it shows okay i've had i've got quite a few faults there so firstly let's talk about the first the obvious faults so that roundabout right at the beginning where the black car was turning i should have stopped the lady why did you move why did you try to go before her i had to stop you there i thought she stopped for me but she didn't yeah so it's a roundabout she's clearly approaching from your right she hasn't got any reason to stop because the vehicle on the left i think i don't know where they were going but she wasn't stopping she was slowing down on approach but we had we should have given her priority and i,1605.29,1663.84,891,196,2iDsolygkKk,2041,https://youtu.be/2iDsolygkKk?t=1605,"would rate the driving situation a 7, as the learner driver made a critical mistake in not giving priority at a roundabout due to unfamiliarity with the area."
had to stop you there so it was dangerous okay the other fault i've got for observation i've got quite a few so i'm trying to miss just place them um there was a lot of clearance faults happening a lot of them that like as we were driving through and they were parked cars parked up if someone else turned up in front you kept squeezing through as opposed to slowing down and stopping really closely and there were two occasions where i was about to break for you oh yeah i think i know near the school yeah near the school there and then right at the beginning there was one as well where i sort of the car had to break a broken brake light you're just going right up close to them and then stopping yeah we shouldn't be going through small spaces you should have just been waiting because the speed around this area what was the speed mostly 20. now why do you think it's 20 miles per hour because it's just really small roads yeah,1665.6,1713.44,933,192,2iDsolygkKk,2041,https://youtu.be/2iDsolygkKk?t=1665,"Critical level: 8 - The driving situation is critical as there were multiple clearance faults and instances where the car had to break because the driver kept squeezing through small spaces, which could result in accidents."
there's loads of hazards and you're sort of just carrying on i know nothing really jumped out in front of you but we shouldn't be at that speed especially not at this time in the morning so you should have been going a lot slower slowing down considering to stop then there was that right turn that we did on the high street just after the high street what happened with that right turn where the no entry was where the man was telling you oh yeah yeah i yeah that yeah yeah so even if you looked on the sat nav at that point there were two lines in the first year i did see the two lines i didn't i didn't know yeah but yeah i sort of thought okay good he looks like he's going into the no entry and i had to wait until you know you're about to commit to it yeah you sort of went there and just sat there and then looked in and that's when the man was telling you not to turn in i i realized when um you know there was,1716.0,1760.48,919,199,2iDsolygkKk,2041,https://youtu.be/2iDsolygkKk?t=1716,"Critical level 8 - There were many hazards on the road and the driver was not paying attention, almost causing a serious accident with the no entry turn."
two cars next to each other yeah just before that and i was like why is this guy on my lane and then he was pointing out i was like oh crap and then i went for it yeah so it took you quite a while to register that so that was that that's why the reason why that would have been a dangerous fault there as well then there was a hesitation on a roundabout and i think this one happened because the observation fought with the black car happened you got to like a t-junction looking roundabout where there was nobody to your right at all there was a vehicle approaching from the left but you'd already gone into the roundabout oh yeah one there's a blue car right yeah yeah so you went into the roundabout and then you just sat there now you waited for the car on the left now she completely stopped and then you carried on now who has priority in that scenario no me sir yeah so we didn't need to wait for her anyways,1762.24,1808.08,915,193,2iDsolygkKk,2041,https://youtu.be/2iDsolygkKk?t=1762,Criticality level: 7 - The hesitation on the roundabout could have potentially caused an accident and there was a misunderstanding of priority rules.
obviously if she was coming in super fast not looking like she's going to stop for you that's more of a safety hazard now but she she didn't look like she was going to move out in front of you so you should have just carried on okay um i didn't like your speed in that high street i felt like you kept whizzing through there was loads of hazards there was loads of large vehicles tight spaces and you kept squeezing through you didn't slow down enough anyways and you didn't consider stopping okay yeah there's there's so much happening now so i think what are you doing i'm trying to think of where the other observation fault was oh there was another right turn you know where the man on the right wanted to cross with the little kid yeah yeah you got to the end of that road now you didn't need to stop for them but once you got to the end of that road you sort of looked right and left there was a vehicle approaching from the left a black car,1810.159,1861.6,947,200,2iDsolygkKk,2041,https://youtu.be/2iDsolygkKk?t=1810,"8 - The driving situation is quite critical as the learner driver is whizzing through a high street with loads of hazards and not slowing down enough.

and you moved in front of him now he wasn't very frustrated but that shouldn't be a gap that we should we should be taking and i had to sort of put my hand up apologizing oh yeah yeah that's the one i was talking about yeah so we shouldn't have moved in front of him either because we should be looking both ways for a safe gap there yeah i think that one was too soon yeah were you rushing to get through what was happening you know when i make one mistake yeah it's like i just give up but you shouldn't do no i know okay i know the mistake at the beginning with the lady yeah okay you knew that was a serious or dangerous fault okay yeah and then i tried to carry on and then i made a think i made another one and now that okay and then then i just i just still tried it you did with the with the clearance things i did feel like you were doing better in the second half with clearance,1862.88,1911.519,888,192,2iDsolygkKk,2041,https://youtu.be/2iDsolygkKk?t=1862,"Critical level: 4 - While the situation wasn't extremely critical, the driving instructor and student made multiple mistakes, such as not checking for a safe gap and rushing to get through, which could lead to accidents if not corrected."
than you than you did in the first half yeah yeah so when we got near the school you were being more cautious and watching the slides and slowing down yeah but then afterwards um it's all crept up again a little bit you just need to be super slow the area is not safe to be driving at the speeds you're trying to drive at yeah yeah actually yeah that's true i didn't agree i didn't even go below like 18. yeah you were always trying to get up to 20. there's a few times where you went up to 21 and you went back down you'd break straight away but it wasn't safe to be driving like 15 when they were parked cars and an oncoming car yeah don't second guess yourself yeah the first bit were you waiting near the school yeah you probably could have gone in forward a bit more but it was only really when that guy flashed his headlights with the black car that he had because he's waiting everyone else sort of come in and then carried on,1913.12,1959.2,933,204,2iDsolygkKk,2041,https://youtu.be/2iDsolygkKk?t=1913,7 - The driving situation is fairly critical because the driver is not being cautious enough in an unsafe area and is driving at speeds that are not appropriate for the conditions.

yeah but let's talk about that when he gave you weight there's space next to him isn't there yeah but what about just after him yeah there's it was getting tighter wasn't it so what should you have done just stopped when does that space yeah so gone next to the black car but just gone slightly ahead of him and stopped or just really clutch control squeeze through whereas you're sort of carrying on five six miles per hour just tucking in and out so it's just too close thinking about clearance how much space do we like to have around the car uh half a meter on your side i think a meter now that makes sense you're trying to leave half a meter we want to leave a meter it's our ideal space so think about when you're walking along on the pavement you don't really go really close to other pedestrians do you no you walk some well away and then carry on even if the high street's busy you tend to sort of,1961.679,2011.279,907,191,2iDsolygkKk,2041,https://youtu.be/2iDsolygkKk?t=1961,"Critical level: 2.

hopefully it doesn't get to that so before we get started i'm just going to ask a quick question there so how would you check if your um brakes are working you you put the obviously the engine then you press the brakes and you see if you can see the lights either you get a friend to check them or check on your reflection okay so not the brake lights how do you test that the brakes are working brakes the brakes are working yeah um you press them down you want to make sure that they don't just fall straight down that there's some sort of pressure when they respond back to you okay that's fine if not you can let the car roll very very slightly okay yeah and see if you can stop with them brilliant sounds good so whenever you're ready if you can just i'm going to put my seats down and everybody can start the car and then we'll get driving awesome that's on and that's on so you're just following the blue line where the arrow is that's where we're going,56.239,108.159,960,202,Z402WyrFIVI,1502,https://youtu.be/Z402WyrFIVI?t=56,Critical level 2. The situation is not critical as it is just a basic checking of the brakes before starting driving.
with the arrow yeah okay so whenever you're ready um drive off forgot to mention i'm going to get you to carry out one maneuver and possibly at the end of the road turn left then cross the roundabout and take the first exit,109.84,133.52,223,47,Z402WyrFIVI,1502,https://youtu.be/Z402WyrFIVI?t=109,"Critical level: 4 - The situation is not very critical as it involves a simple maneuver and a turn, but the roundabout adds a slight complexity."
cross the roundabout and take the first exit look out for hazards like the sparked vehicle that's sticking out over onto the road as this would be difficult to get through with an oncoming vehicle and you may have to stop on approaching the temporary traffic lights ahead alexa positions really well and gets back onto the left-hand side of the road making sure the vehicles ahead can easily get through when waiting at temporary traffic lights always use your mirrors towards the right for any motorbikes or any cyclists overtaking you the road ahead is really narrow with parked vehicles on both sides and oncoming traffic on the right alexa carries on through that space in a slow controlled manner if you want better control for narrow gaps it's a good idea to go down to first gear cross the roundabout and take the second exit the roundabout ahead is a flat painted circle alexa has to go over the roundabout a little bit but she does so with her right side,155.92,236.56,963,188,Z402WyrFIVI,1502,https://youtu.be/Z402WyrFIVI?t=155,"Criticality: 7 - The situation is quite critical as there are hazards present such as obstructing vehicles, temporary traffic lights, narrow road and parked cars.

ties only this would not be counted as a minor fault cross the roundabout and take the second exit then at the end of the road turn right [Music] at the end of the road turn right a350 as the junction on the right was fairly empty this may not get counted as a line of fault but you should normally signal about 80 to 100 yards from the junction or about 8 to 10 car lengths depending on your speed as alexa moves into the new road it's a 30 miles per hour road and she makes good progress getting up to about 25 miles per hour the speed on the screen on the sat nav is slightly lower as it's not connected to the vehicle after 200 yards turn left then cross the roundabout and take the second exit turn left then cross the roundabout and take the second exit,237.28,328.72,759,168,Z402WyrFIVI,1502,https://youtu.be/Z402WyrFIVI?t=237,7 - The situation is critical as Alexa is approaching a roundabout and needs to correctly take the second exit while adjusting her speed and signaling appropriately.

alexa deals with meeting situations really well she times her approach so that she doesn't have to slow down and stop the vehicle to give way to the oncoming vehicles,468.0,474.879,166,33,Z402WyrFIVI,1502,https://youtu.be/Z402WyrFIVI?t=468,"Critical level: 3 - While meeting situations require attention and caution, Alexa's approach is safe and timed well, reducing the criticality of the situation."
after 200 yards turn right a4 then turn left turn right then turn left alexa deals with this nearside turn at the traffic lights really well she goes into the middle of the junction and waits in a good position allowing the cars in front enough space to pass on the right she waits for the traffic lights in front to go red which means it's safe for her to now move through moving off from this position when you can't see behind the blue car that's turning can be very dangerous as there could be a motorbike as the lights turn red the traffic in front should be stopping so it's safe to turn turning into the new road alexa goes straight into the left hand lane this is the normal driving position whenever you turn into a new road dealing with hazards on a road like this you should always use your mirrors and signal in advance so that the traffic around you can see that there's a hazard ahead and has more time to react,493.84,571.68,925,189,Z402WyrFIVI,1502,https://youtu.be/Z402WyrFIVI?t=493,"6 - There are several turns and a junction, and the driver needs to deal with hazards on the road, but Alexa handles the situation well and takes necessary precautions."

okay thank you what i'd like you to do now is to reverse back for about two car lengths keeping reasonably close to and parallel with the pavement as you do this alexa carries out the exercise very carefully using slow clutch control to control her speed while looking over her left and right blind spot making sure there's nobody around the vehicle if someone turns up and they pass your vehicle while you're reversing you should stop only continuing the exercise when the road is clear thank you drive off whenever you're ready before we drive off actually i'm just gonna okay so whenever you're ready let's drive off,769.76,824.16,619,118,Z402WyrFIVI,1502,https://youtu.be/Z402WyrFIVI?t=769,"Critical level: 3 - While it's important to be cautious while reversing, the situation is not particularly critical since there are no other cars in close proximity."

the examiner would usually wait for a nice clear road before they ask you to carry out the controls of the vehicle make sure to keep the steering wheel steady and also to maintain the speed of the road when it's safe to do so i'd like you to demonstrate how you would miss the rear windscreen that's great,943.199,962.32,305,63,Z402WyrFIVI,1502,https://youtu.be/Z402WyrFIVI?t=943,Critical Level: 3 - The driving situation is not critical as the road conditions are clear and there are no obstacles or hazards.

Explanation: Roundabouts can be complex and potentially dangerous due to the likelihood of collisions between multiple vehicles entering and exiting the roundabout at high speeds."
so on approach to the hazard the parked vehicle sticking out alexa should have used her mirrors and potentially signaled to make it clear to others spray that straight on,1064.84,1093.36,170,31,Z402WyrFIVI,1502,https://youtu.be/Z402WyrFIVI?t=1064,"Criticality: 6 - The situation is moderately critical as there is a hazard present (the parked vehicle sticking out), but it is manageable if the driver uses their mirrors and signals appropriately to make their intentions clear to other drivers."

on approach to this right turn at the traffic lights alexa waits for the traffic opposite as they're on her side of the road where she needs to be to turn right and then moves over when it's safe to do so the junction ahead already has two vehicles waiting in the middle alexa waits in a good position making sure she doesn't go onto the cycle box with traffic light junctions usually only two cars can fit in the junction from either side alexa waits in a good position as there were already two vehicles in the middle if she had gone forward she would have either been on the cycle box or on the pedestrian crossing and either of those two would have resulted in a fault,1164.88,1207.6,672,136,Z402WyrFIVI,1502,https://youtu.be/Z402WyrFIVI?t=1164,"7 - The situation is quite critical as there are multiple factors to consider such as oncoming traffic, other vehicles in the middle of the junction, and the position of the cycle box and pedestrian crossing.

parked sticking out now um i wasn't sure if you were checking the right just before because you sort of cannot come up behind him and you've not signaled and you sort of nip in to the right so i wasn't sure if you were using the mirror on the right i know you probably checked earlier but it was just right near the end yeah maybe you put that signal on let everyone know that you're going to go across yeah besides that you really you did really well with the traffic light crossroads you know the ones where you have to stay in the middle yeah so you kept sort of um you kept your position you waited when you couldn't see and then when the traffic lights were red you went through that was nice and the parking exercise the reversing sorry yeah you were looking over both shoulders very nicely like this so it was great and you waited for the bus which was definitely a good idea um something you did when you moved up from that position when you moved off from the right hand side of the road,1371.6,1417.28,996,202,Z402WyrFIVI,1502,https://youtu.be/Z402WyrFIVI?t=1371,"4 - There are some potential dangers with the parked car and moving to the right, but overall the situation is manageable."
there was a bus coming but that wasn't an issue you moved off and you go all the way across towards the left-hand side of the road so that was really good because then the bus in front he was able to easily get through with you you sort of put his hand up nice and clear so it was really good when you moved across from the right towards the left fully and you were nice and straight otherwise you would have been blocking the bus right yep but yeah not a lot of uh oh yeah and also you remember when we were on the dual carriageway yeah the people broken down oh yeah that's three cars yeah yeah um did you see that earlier yeah that's why i moved over yeah just just maybe put that signal on a bit earlier let the person on the right know for a little while but you moved over lanes very nicely you even leaned forward to check that mirror as opposed to just moving over which was nice and even moving back in towards the left lane so yeah well,1419.2,1464.0,946,199,Z402WyrFIVI,1502,https://youtu.be/Z402WyrFIVI?t=1419,"Critical level: 2 - While there were a few minor elements to consider, the situation was not particularly critical as the bus and broken down cars posed no immediate danger to the driver or other road users."
everything's good there wasn't a lot going on for me to talk about oh happy days that was a nice try the roads were quick the the roads were clear which was sort of to your advantage there a little bit but no you you did drive really well um just with first gear sometimes when you go into first you kind of look down right okay you don't want to be looking down yeah just knock it into one yeah so hold on sick happy days yeah well done so yeah i hope you guys found that video useful and this helps you pass your test you,1464.72,1502.24,523,111,Z402WyrFIVI,1502,https://youtu.be/Z402WyrFIVI?t=1464,"Critical level: 1.

hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving my name is amin and today i'm doing a mock test for malik now malik has done four driving tests in the past and unfortunately he failed this is his third lesson with me previously he's been learning to drive with his parents so he's never really driven with an instructor before this and yeah so before we get started um i'm gonna take a little bit about the test so throughout the drive i want you to follow the road ahead whenever i need you to turn i will tell you in plenty of time if i don't say anything keep going straight if you're not sure where you're going you can ask i'm going to get you to carry out one maneuver and we may also carry out the emergency stop okay now i'm going to get you to follow the sat nav for about 20 minutes or so and then i'll give you normal directions afterwards okay now before we get started could you tell,16.8,61.68,894,191,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=16,"me if there are any critical driving situations in this fragment?

me how would you check if your power system steering is working or not how would you check if there was a problem with your power assisted steering so i would do this by spinning the wheel around when i turn on the car by spinning it around okay once it's been turned on if it's specifically difficult then i would need to get it checked with the mechanic but if it does spin relatively you know as a as per my experience it should be fine okay that's fine okay so whenever you're ready all right okay so whenever you're ready let's drive off,63.44,94.72,542,111,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=63,"Critical level: 2.

at the end of the road turn left turn left if you can pull over and park up on the right hand side of the road please don't worry about the drives on this occasion at the end of the road turn right so what i'd like you to do now is to reverse back for about two car lengths keeping reasonably close to and parallel with the pavement as you carry out the exercise we've got two car nuts here,138.319,186.8,390,84,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=138,"Critical level: 6 - The situation is relatively critical as the learner is asked to reverse for two car lengths while making sure to stay close and parallel to the pavement, with the presence of two cars nearby adding pressure."
really slowly looking over his left and right blind spot making sure there are no vehicles or pedestrians around him [Music] thank you and move in front of you ready when moving up from the right hand side of the road you should start from your right blind spot and finish checking over into your left blind spot into the road to make sure it's clear turn right,202.56,255.36,361,71,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=202,"2 - Though it's important to always check blind spots before merging, the situation in this particular moment is not necessarily critical as the car is moving slowly and there is no indication of imminent danger."
so after 200 yards cross the roundabout and take the second exit then at the end of the world tournament malik has a habit of keeping his left foot hovering over the clutch even when he's not using it this results in him coasting on a lot of the stop as he puts the clutch down first whenever he needs to slow down this isn't good for your control whenever you need to stop the car across the roundabout and take the second exit then at the end of the road turn left,280.84,325.68,466,100,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=280,5 - The situation is somewhat critical since the driver is exhibiting bad habits that could potentially affect their control of the car in certain situations.
on approach to meeting traffic on this road malik keeps his position fairly centre of the road he should have moved a little bit towards the left to make it easier for the vehicles in front to get through,351.36,359.44,204,40,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=351,"Criticality: 6 - While not an emergency situation, this is a moderately critical situation because Malik's position could potentially cause issues for other vehicles on the road."

after 200 yards on approach to this right turn at the mini roundabout malik doesn't signal until he gets the very top of the roundabout now this would be a serious fault as nobody ahead knows that he's turning right,445.44,476.84,215,46,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=445,"8 - Malik's failure to signal until the very top of the roundabout poses a serious hazard to other drivers, as they are unaware that he intends to turn right."

malik hesitates to move off from this parked position there's no vehicles behind him he's simply waiting for the vehicle's oncoming to pass but there's enough space in front of him to move off,621.92,631.36,192,41,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=621,"3 - While there is some pressure to move off, the lack of oncoming vehicles means the situation is not very critical."
the vehicle in front is trying to reverse park into a space on their side of the road malik gets really close and stops right in front of them he should have stopped in the position on the left hand side of the road allowing enough space for anyone to come through the middle if anyone was stuck behind them when waiting for someone you should always wait on the left hand side of the road making sure the right hand side is clear for any oncoming vehicles,656.399,677.12,456,90,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=656,"Critical level: 7 - The situation is quite critical as there is a vehicle trying to reverse park and if Malik got any closer it could result in an accident. Additionally, blocking the road can cause inconvenience for other road users."
as the vehicle finishes parking malik should have moved through the middle of the road and moved up to the end of the road he carried on waiting resulting in a meeting situation with the oncoming vehicles we're doing a right turn just ignore the sat nav sorry it goes a bit funny at this point malik should have moved into the space on the left or carried on through the road at this point maleki whatever you think is safe at this point the silver climb front was actually waiting for malik to move into the space on the left-hand side ahead of the black vehicle,699.68,741.12,563,114,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=699,Critical level: 8 - Malik's failure to move through the middle of the road and his continued waiting resulted in a potentially dangerous meeting situation with oncoming vehicles.
sorry it's not in here properly malik should have kept both hands on the steering wheel to make it easier to steer the wheel whilst reversing and looking over both right and left blind spot he neglected his right blind spot while reversing so we're going right at the end of the road okay while waiting at junction for the gradient make sure there are no pedestrians crossing behind you whilst you're trying to move off malik rolled back at this point the vehicles on the right were piling up as they were turning into the road where we were waiting malik should have used this as a gap to go forward slowly and once you're out halfway it's easier to get into the new road,759.92,819.76,672,135,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=759,"8 - The driving situation is very critical because Malik neglected his blind spot and rolled back, causing a potential danger to the vehicles turning into the road where they were waiting."
when there were no vehicles on the road approaching from the right malik should have used clutch control to slowly peep and creep to get a better view of the road on the right malik needs to start moving forward slowly as the traffic is piling up on the road on the right and behind us malik you need to move slowly forward when nobody's there otherwise you're not gonna be able to see any better okay,848.399,874.24,401,84,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=848,"Critical level: 6

The driving situation is not critical at all as the car is stationary and not in motion. The task given is a simple demonstration of switching on the front demister."
on the sat nav it says we're going to be making the right turn in 700 yards malik moves into the overtaking lane now he should have stayed in the overtaking lane as he's making a right turn soon he starts using his mirrors to move back into the left-hand lane now this would go down as awareness and planning as he doesn't need to be in the left-hand lane,955.199,973.12,355,79,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=955,"Critical level: 3. 

While it's important for the driver to be aware of their surroundings and plan ahead, this situation is not particularly critical as a mistake here is unlikely to result in immediate danger."
on approach to this roundabout to turn right third exit malik should have been in the far right lane he gets into the middle lane which is actually the third lane now this lane is only used to go straight ahead go right on the roundabout and take the third exit,1005.839,1020.48,261,54,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=1005,Criticality: 8 - Malik's mistake could potentially cause a collision or inconvenience other drivers on the road as he is not in the proper lane for his intended turn.
as he goes into the roundabout he realizes that his lane does not turn right so he stays in this lane and takes the second exit now this would not be counted as a serious fault in the test as he's not doing anything wrong he simply went the wrong way take the exit a312 and we're just headed off in the wrong direction at the moment i'm just going to give you directions from here on just ignore the santa for now turn left then turn around when possible when you get to the traffic lights at the end of the road,1037.36,1073.76,512,108,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=1037,Critical level: 2. The situation is not critical as the driver is not doing anything wrong and the instructor is providing directions to correct the mistake.
the turning right of these traffic lights malik should have been signaling as pedestrians that are crossing the road on the right or left do not realize that he can only go right from this position so even though it's a compulsory right turn it's always a good idea to use the indicator [Music],1089.12,1110.45,294,59,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=1089,"Critical level 5 - While signaling is not compulsory for a compulsory right turn, it is important in this situation as there are pedestrians crossing the road who may not realize the driver's intended direction."
traffic lights on approach to this right down in the traffic light malik should have used his mirrors towards the right and signaled on approach to the traffic lights,1132.0,1148.84,166,30,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=1132,"Criticality: 6 - The driving situation is fairly critical as Malik missed the opportunity to check his mirrors and signal, which could potentially cause confusion or danger to other drivers."
you can pull an empire from the left just before the van but leave enough space to move away don't worry about the drives on this one when moving off from this position malik forgets to put it into first gear and looks for a safe gap when he realizes he does change gear but he forgets to now look over his right blind spot again you should always check your right blind spot as the last check before moving away,1196.96,1232.84,412,85,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=1196,"Critical level: 7 - The situation is critical because the learner forgot to check his right blind spot before moving away, which could result in a potential accident."
at the roundabout i'd like you to follow the road ahead it's the second exit malek approaches the roundabout really well starting from the left and then going into the middle lane to follow the road ahead,1254.64,1268.48,204,42,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=1254,"5 - Malek's approach to the roundabout is good, but the situation becomes slightly more critical as it requires navigating a roundabout, although following the road ahead reduces the complexity."
come on just take the first row on the left just here,1288.0,1302.84,53,12,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=1288,2 - The situation is not very critical as it seems to be a simple instruction to take the first row on the left.
on approach to this roundabout malik should have slowed down selecting second gear and looking on approach as it's a very open junction he also forgets the signal,1328.24,1335.679,162,32,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=1328,"Critical level: 7 

The situation is quite critical as approaching a roundabout without slowing down can lead to accidents, and forgetting to signal can cause confusion for other drivers."
at the traffic last time on approach to the traffic lights to turn right there were two lanes turning right malik should have gone in the first of the two lane as that's the position normal driving on approach to the stop malik should have braked for a little bit longer before putting the clutch down he ends up stopping in the cycle box this was a result because of the coasting on approach to the stop putting the clutch down early is not good for control as malik turns right at the traffic lights from the overtaking position he stays in the right-hand lane as he turns into the new road as the lanes merge in the new road this would not be counted as a minor or a serious fault,1355.52,1400.4,683,140,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=1355,"Critical level: 3 - The situation was not overly critical, but Malik could have made some driving errors that could potentially cause problems."
on approach to this roundabout to turn right third exit malik should have been signaling right on approach as it makes it very clear to the drivers ahead that you're going past 12 o'clock,1451.679,1460.72,187,39,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=1451,"Criticality: 5 - Signals play an important role in informing other drivers of our intentions, making it critical to properly use them, especially in busy areas."

if you can put it in parking lot in the shade thank you for your test how was the drive for you medic it was okay i did have some challenges i didn't go on to the right lane when you wanted the roundabout but i didn't panic either so i went round the and i followed the road no you did well on that one you went and you went the wrong way but that was fine but there are a few serious faults and dangerous faults also okay so i'm going to go through them to help people understand this firstly the first fault that i've got down is um the most important one there were so many occasions when you did not signal i thought that yeah yeah especially on roundabouts there was a roundabout left turn there was two roundabouts where we turned right one of which you signaled once you got there as you started the turn which was actually way too late so that would be a serious fault the other one was um just at the end,1553.2,1617.919,913,192,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=1553,"Critical level: 8 - The student's failure to signal on multiple occasions, especially on roundabouts, can pose a danger to other drivers on the road."
here now that so roundabout we're turning right and again no signal right on approach you've gone into the roundabout and you've signaled left to exit but how does anybody know you're you're gonna be making a right turn okay so there's a lot of um signals missing then there was that right turn that we were sort of stuck at for a while yeah okay now with that particular right turn when we first got there there was a bit of a situation where the car was trying to park now you should have stopped in a position where you're on your side of the road so that if he doesn't park firstly you give him a bit more space stop about two car lengths in advance and then once he gets out the way if somebody had been stuck behind him they can get through you sort of stopped in the middle yeah then when he did park and he was out of your path you just sat there yeah he was out of your way there was enough space for you to get through,1620.559,1668.399,928,197,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=1620,Criticality level: 7 - The student driver is not using signals correctly in a roundabout and has trouble navigating a right turn where another car is parked. The situation could have caused congestion and possible accidents.
but then you didn't get through now the next car turned up that made the whole situation a lot worse yeah by the time yeah you didn't have to reverse right yeah yeah now with the reversing i don't know why but you're putting your arm at the back of my seat and trying to look this way now with that you're restricting yourself from that view on the back right there yeah there's loads of nice windows in this car and you can use your car or your mirrors as well so you've got to make sure you have a good look around and keep reversing and keep looking around in your mirrors and your blind spots but you've got to be able to turn the wheel also because you can't turn with one hand on the steering can you yes you had a bit of trouble with the reversing part and then eventually when we got to the end of that road there was a bit of a pile up on the right the big range rover was blocking your view,1670.159,1712.159,900,192,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=1670,"Criticality: 7 - The situation becomes critical with the appearance of the next car and worsens with the pile-up, making it important to be alert and vigilant while reversing and using mirrors and blind spots to ensure a safe driving experience."
now you could see behind her there was a few cards and they were waiting at first you should have gone forward but you carried on waiting so you hesitated there now by the time you got to the end now you're right next to this car and you can't see anything to the right there was intermittent traffic what you needed to do was move forward slowly when there was nobody and keep focusing your attention on the right side because that's where cars were coming out first castle that right turn was a little bit too messy and then we had that um second exit straight ahead at willow tree where you had to wait a little while before we could go in as you went into the roundabout you've straight line that roundabout yeah instead of jump jumping to the up yeah so you've gone into the roundabout straight as opposed to your lane which was over across to the left now we've practiced that roundabout i was expecting you to definitely know that one yeah okay but we only ended up there because you went the wrong way,1713.2,1765.679,1009,204,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=1713,"Critical level: 8

The driving situation was critical because the driver hesitated and ended up in a dangerous situation with limited visibility, had a messy turn, and made a mistake at a roundabout, which could have caused an accident."
um then of course there's a bit of a steering one now this one is more of an advisory serious than an actual series but it definitely would have been a fault i asked you to park up on the left and you were bumped into the pavement there and scratched the alloy so that wasn't very nice when parking just gradually come into this position use whatever's in front of you to know when you're in a nice straight line but also use the red sticker mark at the front get the pavement roughly in the middle of the windscreen and then once you're here you can use the left mirror to see the space but don't use the left mirror to close the gap got it okay um then it was moving off safety when you're moving off from a parked position you're not checking your blind spot enough when i asked you to reverse on the right the maneuver the maneuver itself was really nice when you moved off from that position you didn't check your left blind spot,1767.44,1815.44,934,192,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=1767,Driving situation: 6 - The situation is critical because there is a risk of damaging the car and potential danger to pedestrians or other vehicles. The driver is not checking their blind spot adequately and has already scratched the alloy wheel while parking.
you did use your mirrors in front and so on but by the time you're actually moving there's no left mirror left blind spot check okay then there's that response to uh road marking when we stopped in the cycle box yes i i recognize that one straight away now i feel like with that particular one and a few of your stops and your approach to roundabouts and stuff you have a habit of coasting what's coasting is it stopping early or like being a bit in the clutch down first thing sometimes you've been at 20 miles per hour and you have to stop by the end and the first thing you're doing is getting the clutch down now with that what happens when you coast it it doesn't stop properly yes the car actually speeds up so on that particular occasion where you stopped in the crossing again the same thing because you've got the clutch down first you ended up stopping in the uh crossing there in the cycle box sorry but you've got to make sure every time that you um slow down you,1818.0,1874.0,975,202,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=1818,"would give way to those who have the right of way.

you slow the car down with the brake then use the clutch when you need to you keep putting the clutch down straight away and the other thing so that i've got a minor fault for awareness and planning this was when you were driving in the overtaking lane on the dual carriageway and the sat nav actually had a right turn um indicator on and you kept trying to move into the left lane yeah yeah but yeah i need to the the setting up i want to jump in the left lane but then as it gradually went forward i i recognized that there was no point and we were getting yeah so at the time that you were trying to move into the left lane um it said six seven hundred yards now i know that's quite a while but you're on a dual carriageway it's a 40 miles per hour road everyone's driving that speed just get to it plus you're turning it doesn't make sense to be on the left then to come back again,1875.84,1922.08,885,195,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=1875,I would rate the situation as a 7 as the student's confusion and attempted lane changes could have potentially caused an accident on the dual carriageway.
yeah you got it you're just making it harder for yourself there got it okay got it so the biggest issue you're saying is signals yeah on round the back there was a right turn that we did as well traffic light right turn where you completely approached in the right hand lane no signal as you've gone into the junction you've then signaled i know the one you're talking about that i was i wasn't sure in a road which essentially read to the right okay there were two right turns on traffic lights which you should have signaled on yeah so even if it's a compulsory right turn pedestrians do they realize that you're going to go that way not always no no because it's only when you drive especially know the area you know when a certain car is going to turn a certain way yeah but if you don't obviously you wouldn't know that's it got it okay fantastic so that's something i'm going to need to keep in mind okay,1922.96,1969.2,910,189,-sNVaI4Por8,2005,https://youtu.be/-sNVaI4Por8?t=1922,"I would rate the driving situation as a 6 due to the lack of signaling during critical turns, which could result in confusion or danger for other drivers and pedestrians."

okay brilliant okay are we like too far we are a little bit but it doesn't matter too much don't worry because the road road's quite wide so keep looking around a little bit slower which way do we turn at the first reference okay so you're looking left move slowly and there you go now look the other way bring it okay where else you look sit up a bit taller set up a bit taller so you can see it better okay how would you say you've parked that time just take the gear out for a minute um i'm too far away from there yeah what happened how did you end up too far uh just switch off the engine and turn the hammer on for a second brilliant yes so what reference made you turn too far down the pavement now a triangle triangle had it quite disappeared no i guess because like i started so far out it was like further out of time so um yeah no that one that didn't affect us too much in regards to the position here,1683.039,1794.0,913,194,1zF_GhGeoBI,2079,https://youtu.be/1zF_GhGeoBI?t=1683,"Critical level: 2 - The situation is not critical at all as the road is quite wide and there are no other cars around, but the driver needs to pay attention to their positioning when turning."
this this position here from the pavement is actually due to that triangle reference yeah and remember when you're looking at that mirror because you're sitting so far to the right you can't see the back tire can you but i can so when you're sitting there you've got to make sure you lean across and lift your head up because if you just so you can see that tight so you can see the back tire a bit more because that's where the gap has to close yeah so try and lean across lift your head up a bit more and once it really closes or even wait a second after it's disappeared and then turn okay because it's mainly that reference that we could have improved on yeah and the other thing was the angle wasn't quite 45 yeah so because of that we were traveling for ages and the triangle was still visible which is probably what misled you a little bit so you're probably thinking oh i need to turn by now and just,1796.0,1842.24,908,189,1zF_GhGeoBI,2079,https://youtu.be/1zF_GhGeoBI?t=1796,"I would rate this situation as a 5 - it's important to pay attention to the mirror and use the reference triangle, but it's not an immediate danger."
even if the triangles are even if the angle's a bit early just don't worry just keep it going keep it going until the back really closes because we've got enough space from the car behind anyways yeah okay should we try it again yeah you want to try it on your own without me prompting you yeah okay the only thing i was really having to prompt you with there was to keep looking around yeah in case someone turns up should you just like off to each point yeah so if you've been looking one way for a while just quick glance and then back again because how long does it take for someone to step out of their house and cross the road not very long okay all right when you're ready okay okay so that you're gonna do this one on your own i'm just gonna turn that off because that will go off otherwise,1844.48,1886.48,798,166,1zF_GhGeoBI,2079,https://youtu.be/1zF_GhGeoBI?t=1844,3 - The driving situation is moderately critical because the learner driver is practicing a specific maneuver (keeping distance from the car in front) and is being encouraged to stay aware of the surroundings.

quickly turn it quickly stop that that was the front tire you could feel it resisted a little bit yeah because the back of it was sticking out the car from it and is it on okay that's a really good park you're definitely quite close there you can see here if you have a look yeah yep but if you're unsure of the distance try and lean across a bit more because that's the only way of seeing that so we're really nicely in line with the car but yeah if you feel that the front tire is touching it's because the back of it is sticking out because your car was straight yeah so you just needed to straight up straighten out the wheel all right okay good on that one i just had to prompt you to slow down and turn at the end there because we we came in really nicely but you were hesitating on that reference yeah don't dwell on it too much as long as it looks like it's roughly there just,2002.64,2058.24,884,191,1zF_GhGeoBI,2079,https://youtu.be/1zF_GhGeoBI?t=2002,"Critical level: 6 - While the situation is not overly dangerous, there is potential for the driver to hit another car while parking and the need for prompt corrective action was necessary."

hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving my name is aman and today i'm doing another driving lesson for eloise now louise we've been driving for how long very long like off and on yeah off and on for a very long time um you haven't had regular practice down for a while but you have been driving a little bit on and off with your parents as well yeah okay so today's lesson we're going to be working on crossroads now we have done crossroads before but today's some of the trickier junctions around here so some of them will be nearside others are offside and i want to see how you deal with them on your own but i think for the first one cause it's pretty tricky one on the first one i will talk you through that okay but we're going to be looking at road markings and how to position to turn okay so whenever you're ready we will get started um we'll just head out this way because,16.16,66.32,888,195,Zch_elibyaE,1753,https://youtu.be/Zch_elibyaE?t=16,"Critical level: 5 - While crossroads can be tricky, the instructor plans to talk Eloise through the first one and is mainly focused on teaching her how to position for turns and understand road markings, making it a moderately critical situation."
it's a very empty quiet clock up think about what you need to do nice and relaxed just look around how you would normally okay so we're just gonna head out straight from here okay so when we get out the junction there we're gonna turn left right corner don't we try and lean forward if you can't see past that tree might be to see a bit better then is there a gap coming up any chances it's a bit busy in the morning isn't it yeah yeah now they're not very fast on that road so you don't need the road to be empty is it giving way oh great thank you mister it's because they're traveling slowly anyways okay so at the roundabout we're gonna turn left first exit,68.56,142.879,661,146,Zch_elibyaE,1753,https://youtu.be/Zch_elibyaE?t=68,"3 - The driving situation is mildly critical as there is some traffic, but it's not too fast or too congested."
good just look in the top and left i know those cyclists really go up next to you but you never know well the traffic's really picked up now it was empty before now as it's busy go forward slowly into the junction now that silver car is going to come in once you're here just stop and eye contact with the silver car driver now if they're looking at you they're going to give way if they don't look at you they won't give way brilliant you can see that straight away thank you good so at the roundabout we're taking the road ahead it's slightly to the right so you want to position on the right for this one you have a look across are we good to go yeah yeah well done because it's a straight we don't really need to signal but if you want to make it clear you can i don't think it was necessarily on that one and again road ahead so more to the right you can just stay on the right again,164.08,241.68,888,194,Zch_elibyaE,1753,https://youtu.be/Zch_elibyaE?t=164,"8 - The traffic has picked up and there are cyclists and a silver car approaching the junction making it critical to stop and make eye contact with the driver to ensure they give way.

at the traffic lights we're going to turn right so we've got signal just yet we'll use our mirrors go all the way forward you can go in that space keep it going it's hatched broken white lines isn't it yeah we won't get through the first or second set but i want you to watch that yellow lorry can you see how he's sitting in the middle yeah now the road ahead the black car and the red car are all coming through but he has to just keep sitting there now the lights are red but you can't see them penny no he's just gonna keep waiting so the traffic lights on the opposite side are actually green for a lot longer so you're gonna position it like that and just sit there okay the traffic in front will be blocking your view okay but you don't want to go any further to see if it's clear it's gonna puts you in even more danger now as the junction is quite big on this side usually three maybe even four cars can get through,242.959,315.759,924,201,Zch_elibyaE,1753,https://youtu.be/Zch_elibyaE?t=242,"Critical level: 7 - The situation is relatively critical as there are multiple cars and a large vehicle blocking our view, and we need to be cautious and patient to ensure safety."
okay on the average junction how many cars get through two so you see how the black car's waiting again now notice their position that's roughly as far as you can go when you go into the middle as well also notice how quickly the traffic on the left starts after the last car is gone so once you notice the traffic in front has started to slow down you're going to go forward if you stop you can just turn straight away the right turn at this traffic light crossroads is a near side turn the vehicles in front will be blocking the view and will have to keep waiting until the traffic light change to red while the traffic in front starts to move and we can see the road ahead is cleared to turn on this particular right turn there is no traffic light once you're in the middle so you just need to make sure the traffic in front clears and it's safe for you to turn before you do normally when you move into the new road you aim for the far left lane as that's,317.919,381.199,959,198,Zch_elibyaE,1753,https://youtu.be/Zch_elibyaE?t=317,"Critical level: 5.

as we've moved forward the van in the far left lane started really quickly and was trying to overtake on the left just keep an eye on this blue one's being a bit silly what he's doing now go forward slowly but we can't go any further until you know it's clear yeah yeah okay check the left mirror and turn straight into that left lane i don't know what this fan is doing sorry that's not your fault changing it with you just being idiot relax clutch up slowly he's being a total idiot there move to the right and just keep going it's okay so as we turned the lights there when we were in the middle obviously the traffic on the left started and you started off very quickly yeah just keep an eye on the left as you go forward you're in the middle you need to clear it yeah but he was just trying to sort of push ahead and i think he wanted you to probably take a tighter turn going to,418.72,488.16,884,189,Zch_elibyaE,1753,https://youtu.be/Zch_elibyaE?t=418,8 - The situation is quite critical as the van in the far left lane is trying to overtake on the left and the driver needs to be cautious and keep an eye out for any sudden movements while clearing the traffic on the left.
the other lanes but if you can see he's there you can take time to turn okay we want to aim to the left lane but if he's there we'll try and go up to that town again a bit later okay but now you know that's something to consider okay now what we're going to do is we're going to take the next road on the left it's coming up shortly it's literally just after this van the signal on just get that break in we're turning here slow it down a bit more that's it now go down to second gear focus on the brake clutch up slowly and here we go you got to come off the brake what happened put the clutch down car switched off clutch up slowly catch up all right the car switched off there what what's going on the brake yes i didn't want to say about switching down gears slow it down a bit here now check the right side signal right i'll stop there break clutch quickly just just wait for him we don't know,489.52,554.88,898,199,Zch_elibyaE,1753,https://youtu.be/Zch_elibyaE?t=489,"Criticality: 5 - The situation is moderately critical as the student struggled with switching gears and the car switched off, but no immediate danger is present."
what he's doing we'll talk about that later okay you switched down again nicely but you just didn't come off the break so the car thing so you want to keep on slowing down you've done that really well in the past i think you're just uh panicking a little bit okay now check right mirror is there traffic ahead on the opposite side i don't think so okay signal right maybe just signal right in the meantime if this guy's not moving once he's stopped and you can see the road just check right and start moving right a little bit from your position turn a little bit is it clearer here yeah yeah and then check the mirror and then go all the way across hold up now we're going to turn right just up there but you have to turn after the island okay good just a bit right here watch the kid and turn after him there we are good just get your hands a little bit higher on the wheel as well like this okay so the traffic lights when we go right again position in the middle,556.08,624.16,966,203,Zch_elibyaE,1753,https://youtu.be/Zch_elibyaE?t=556,"Critical level: 4.

it's a near side turn this one's a lot easier than the other one okay we could have dealt with that a bit gone into the other name yeah that's it so if you've seen that he's there and he's coming in and he's trying to speed up just take that turn tighter because there's no harm in that is there no because we can always move back to the left one safe yeah so you want to be a bit more defensive about your drive whether you're in the middle and it's your priority just check okay i can't believe that van driver he's really weaving out in and out yeah he was driving really bad he wasn't a good driver there but that's the type of drivers that you need to be alert about even if you're doing everything perfectly you get the odd occasion where someone just suddenly moves in front of you and you want to be able to deal with it safely yeah and this is why we always check our mirrors regularly because people,626.16,678.88,909,195,Zch_elibyaE,1753,https://youtu.be/Zch_elibyaE?t=626,"Critical level: 5 - While the situation is not currently critical, the instructor emphasizes the importance of being alert for erratic drivers by checking mirrors regularly."
swerving in and out behind and you know someone's been a little bit dodgy just keep your distance from it's the safest way to deal with it yeah all right so what should we do now when we go forward get it so you want to go close to the line very nicely there we are so again about three cars went into that didn't they yeah again watch from the last car turning how long it takes for the main road to actually start as well we're planning to stop here in the middle we're going to take the next road on the left after the bus stop see that road yeah now you need to break you're already in second gear look at your speed make sure it gets comes down to about 15. bring it down a bit more a bit more and once you're turning don't break too heavy and you're just tucking you will okay now let's turn left from here good just check the mirrors again now make sure you go really slow here stop stop stop stop,680.56,763.6,904,199,Zch_elibyaE,1753,https://youtu.be/Zch_elibyaE?t=680,"Critical level 6 - The situation involves multiple factors such as dodgy driving, multiple cars, and the need to turn left onto a busy road after a bus stop, requiring the driver to pay close attention and use caution in their actions."
well done now that's not your fault they were cutting that corner go slowly up to the end really carefully looking out for pedestrians first lean forward look past the hedges hold on and just tuck in a little tighter on this one yeah that black car is completely cut in the corner so when you've seen them coming in like that just make sure you stop otherwise if we carry on we're hitting to their side won't we yeah so just wait for the bus the bus looks like he's going to go forward now because the lights have just changed now eye contact come out forward the first half yeah come out forward brilliant thank you and tuck into that corner quickly turn it the other way and close to the center line signal on yeah we're going to wait because that bus is coming straight to break and stop there good now we can see there's one more car and then the lights have changed to just turn and as you're turning just check the left and then you go,766.32,824.24,941,194,Zch_elibyaE,1753,https://youtu.be/Zch_elibyaE?t=766,"Critical level: 8 - The situation is critical because there are pedestrians to watch out for, a car cutting the corner and the need to avoid hitting them, and a bus approaching which requires communication and making a quick stop."

all the way because they're very square aren't they yeah and then just let it roll if that still feels too too fast you would go down to first gear good break a bit and release the pressure slowly did that gap feel too narrow with the white car a little bit then why didn't you stop okay i [Music] but that was okay though but if you're uncomfortable with the space just stop so we're going left at the roundabout you can't see too far to the right well done all right there we are that guy was holding everybody up yeah there's about three traffic light turns i really want to try one's the one that we just did yeah but without me talking you through it at all okay once the other one will be had the van earlier yeah and there's another one where you have to position a bit awkward in the middle [Music] as eloise turns into this new road she should have put her position in the center of the road and,900.88,994.88,904,194,Zch_elibyaE,1753,https://youtu.be/Zch_elibyaE?t=900,"4 - The driving situation is slightly critical as the learner driver is navigating through roundabouts and traffic lights, but there is no immediate danger."

going to check the mirror yeah he wanted to stop for you too but that was better right yeah just when you're moving out from that position always use the mirrors to the right before you move out what are we looking out for in that right-hand mirror yeah motorbikes right okay we're gonna go right at these lights this is the one i want you to try on your own today so think about the position keep going this is not space one more and louise we're going right,1086.72,1116.72,459,97,Zch_elibyaE,1753,https://youtu.be/Zch_elibyaE?t=1086,6 - The situation is potentially critical due to the upcoming turn at the lights which requires the driver to be aware of the position of the car and any potential hazards.
okay guys let's make some more [Music] good really quickly up to the speed of the road because we're going to be turning right at the big set traffic lights so we're going to move into the top lane and safe some mirrors just lean forward into the right hand mirror and keep checking and move over again we're going to go through that big junction up there at the lights traffic lights are now turning red so we're turning right at that point i want you to really pay attention to the road markings and try this one on your own as well it's okay get that clutch back out that's where the control lines get that clutch out and then back down when you're closer okay all right which way are we going by the way thank you that needs to be on in advance okay so look at the markings in the middle try and fit yourself into that center good now turn it the other way turn the front left yeah travel forward a little bit more and then just sit there,1132.72,1223.44,942,196,Zch_elibyaE,1753,https://youtu.be/Zch_elibyaE?t=1132,"I would rate the driving situation as a 7 out of 10 because they are approaching a big junction with traffic lights turning red, and the driver needs to pay attention to road markings and execute a potentially challenging right turn."
so that's quite easy because no one's in front yeah but if someone was in front you have to keep waiting until the traffic lights on the right had changed quickly from here good anything else before you move right good good in the mirror check start moving another blue car's there but you can keep going forward as there's space for them on the right isn't there good [Music] i'll take the next round on the left just after the van okay left hand at the end of the road that's where the white car is just go up forward without turning on this one so your back tire goes over now when the right's clear is it clear he's in the other lane isn't he taking a tighter turn into the left tighter go out a bit more and then turn there we are lights are green for us keep it moving a bit quicker yeah so we're gonna repeat this junction now just check the right side again okay now on the roundabout we're gonna,1232.159,1338.88,904,193,Zch_elibyaE,1753,https://youtu.be/Zch_elibyaE?t=1232,"give a number: 5

make a u-turn and come back see the boys well done now signal right to make a u-turn it's good there's enough space on the right just to spin it around but just make sure you're looking where you're headed so go in close to the circle so that we're not going into the left keep it straight now looking over your shoulder with this one turn around look where you're going there you go that way everyone would know that you're definitely making a u-turn instead of a right turn so traffic lights turn right,1340.24,1375.919,504,106,Zch_elibyaE,1753,https://youtu.be/Zch_elibyaE?t=1340,"Critical level: 3 - The situation is not overly critical as the road seems relatively quiet and there is enough space to make a safe maneuver.

when we're waiting in the middle to make this right turn eloise should have carried on waiting until she could see the road ahead to be clear the black car happened to be turning right so it was safe but if they were coming straight on that would have been a dangerous turn to take okay it's fine but that's one of those risks that you don't really want to take yeah because i know he happened to be turning right with what robot is coming straight at the traffic lights we're going to turn right so try this again and this will be the last junction that we're turning right here what should we do for turning right the approach seemed a little fast but then you managed to control it you knew you were turning right yeah okay uh i have no idea just give him lots of clearance these runners are always crazy it's a bit like cyclists when there's a cycle path they'll still go in the road,1391.12,1522.799,887,182,Zch_elibyaE,1753,https://youtu.be/Zch_elibyaE?t=1391,Critical level: 6 - The driving situation is not extremely critical but there is still a risk of danger if the oncoming traffic is straight ahead during a right turn.

[Music] hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving today i'm doing another listen to sammy now he's got his test later on today so we're gonna go for a nice little drive just to a mixture of roundabouts uh junctions just see how he does on his own you ready yep okay let's get started [Music],0.05,32.64,295,70,cB-WDXkptWc,1019,https://youtu.be/cB-WDXkptWc?t=0,"Critical Level: 4 - The situation is not extremely critical, but it is still important as the learner is going for a test later in the day and needs to practice different types of junctions and roundabouts."
at the end of the road turn right and then right again there are two turns quite close together here okay on approach to this t-junction sami positions back to the left-hand side really well but stays next to the center line to make his right turn,58.64,77.2,247,51,cB-WDXkptWc,1019,https://youtu.be/cB-WDXkptWc?t=58,"4 - The situation is relatively low criticality since it is just a T-junction with two turns quite close together, but it still requires some attention and proper positioning."
[Music] the speed limit on the new road has changed to 40 miles per hour sami makes good progress if there are street lamps present but no signs then the norm is 30 miles per hour if the speed is above or below 30 there will be repeated signs present at the roundabout take the third exit right on approach to this roundabout right turn sami signals a little bit early but as he's traveling at 40 miles per hour and there are no other right turns present this is not an issue,102.53,147.68,475,104,cB-WDXkptWc,1019,https://youtu.be/cB-WDXkptWc?t=102,"3 - Sami is driving at a moderate speed and is making a routine turn, so the situation is not particularly critical."
sami enters around about confidently as there is a gap on approach as he's making a right turn he's in the right hand lane going around as he notices the second exit ahead of him he starts using his mirrors towards the left and then makes his way towards the left and signals as he passes the island we're now on a 50 slip road leading up to a dual carriageway sami makes really good progress getting up to about 45-50 miles per hour before joining but he forgets to signal now it's always a good idea to signal as this alerts the drivers on the dual carriageway that you're about to come in anything missing there mister signal yeah yeah okay you know you have to go in but make them alert okay so that would be a minor fault there okay when we get to the roundabout i'd like you to take the second exit straight ahead to slow down the vehicle from 40 miles per hour sammy's using,165.519,238.72,881,195,cB-WDXkptWc,1019,https://youtu.be/cB-WDXkptWc?t=165,"Criticality Rating: 4 - While there was a minor fault of not signaling before entering the dual carriageway, the overall situation is not very critical as there are no immediate dangers or obstacles."
a mixture of foot brake and engine brake to get control over the tyres as he's slowing down he's lowering his gears on approach good but we shouldn't be going over that solid line should we no okay on this particular roundabout it's actually easier to be in the right hand lane to go straight because left one is designated for left only okay yeah just if it's safe to do so move over it's annoying because it has a straight arrow but it says harrow which is the first exit only so this lane actually takes you a lot better to the lane you want to be in as sammy moves off from this position he checks his mirrors towards the left as he's moving across to the left a little bit this happens in every roundabout so it's always a good idea to use your left mirror as you enter as sometimes vehicles from the left may straight line the roundabout,240.0,302.0,843,176,cB-WDXkptWc,1019,https://youtu.be/cB-WDXkptWc?t=240,Criticality: 5 - The situation is relatively low criticality as it involves general driving tips and safe lane usage on a roundabout.

so okay now i'd like you to forward park into any space just make sure you finish within the white arms to make this maneuver easier sami should have used slow clutch control to control the speed of the vehicle also to straighten up he should have sat forward to look at the bonnet to see how the lines line up with the sides of the vehicle he ends up going past his straight point as he's using his right hand mirror to straighten up therefore needing to reverse to fix the parking,434.84,464.16,482,99,cB-WDXkptWc,1019,https://youtu.be/cB-WDXkptWc?t=434,"situation. 

Critical level: 7

The situation is fairly critical as the driver has already gone past their straight point and needs to reverse, indicating that the maneuver was not properly executed and may require multiple attempts to complete safely."
okay we're in yeah this wasn't the neatest no it wasn't okay two things yeah so at the very beginning if you know you're gonna park on the right you should have kept your position as far left as possible yeah and then gone into clutch control to come in to make it easier okay and lastly when you wanted to reverse don't stare at the camera right you should have looked over that right blind spot before reversing ah this blind spot yeah yeah you did look over to the left but that right one wasn't checked okay okay whenever you're ready we'll drive out of here do you know how to fix this for next time yeah yeah so you start away from the side you want to actually park okay yeah should i go forward no we'll reverse out first if you want actually yeah just go forward out there i'm going to take their time i was hoping to practice in reversing so rather all your maneuvers you want to be using tight clutch control,479.52,543.279,919,191,cB-WDXkptWc,1019,https://youtu.be/cB-WDXkptWc?t=479,Criticality: 3 - The situation is not very critical. The instructor is giving feedback on how to improve parking and reversing techniques.
yeah you saved yourself a little bit but i thought you know why are you going so fast in the first place all right let's make a right turn here as we exit the car park to make a right turn there was a bus approaching from the left quite fast sammy didn't see the bus and tries to move forward oh sammy the bus yeah did you see the bus yeah i did sorry i'm going to do something yeah okay um we'll talk about it in just a minute sammy had noticed the bus approaching he was planning to go forward and wait halfway but moved too fast the road ahead isn't actually wide enough to wait in the middle you would only go forward halfway if the road is really busy and you find an opening on the right hand side and then an opening on the left approaching don't rush we're not in an eager rush to get out of here keep looking up and down there you go can we take it yeah yeah what happened with the bus just now what was your initial idea when you saw the bus,545.279,615.519,951,206,cB-WDXkptWc,1019,https://youtu.be/cB-WDXkptWc?t=545,"Critical level: 8 - The situation was critical because there was a bus approaching from the left at high speed, and the driver did not initially notice it, which could have resulted in a potential collision."
well did you not see this i think i think i was thinking that i would wait further forward i didn't check well enough yeah okay because it's just with the speed at which you were trying to move out then the way you were turning i thought you were actually going to try and turn in you were moving off too fast even the bus driver probably would have broke to you okay we'll talk about it later all right i'd like you to follow signs towards yeti okay,616.959,645.6,450,95,cB-WDXkptWc,1019,https://youtu.be/cB-WDXkptWc?t=616,"Criticality: 4 - The situation was not extremely critical, but there was a potential danger due to miscommunication between the instructor and the learner driver which could have resulted in a collision."
on approach to this roundabout yeting is the second exit sign posted at 10 o'clock so you'd need to start off in the left-hand lane as you go forward the left-hand lane splits into two and the middle lane is marked for yeting this is a traffic light controlled spiral roundabout when the lights go green you simply need to stay within the white lines and follow your lane and that will take you directly towards your exit sami uses his mirrors and moves back into the left hand lane to exit from the left this wasn't necessary as the middle lane also went to yedding good mirror checks to move over but if you look at the lane next to you yeah that's also yeti i think so yeah you know yeah so the lean chain wasn't necessary it wasn't necessary but it was safe he made sure it was safe but don't bother if it's not necessary okay otherwise it's just more trouble than it is needed,662.72,724.56,881,189,cB-WDXkptWc,1019,https://youtu.be/cB-WDXkptWc?t=662,"4 - The situation is somewhat critical as it involves navigating a traffic light controlled roundabout with lane splitting, but the driver is providing clear instructions and the actions taken by the student are safe."
there's a new bus lane starting on the left sami notices the timing and realizes he can be in the bus lane so he uses his mirrors and moves straight in if somebody had been behind him he would have had to signal to now switch lanes there well done traffic lights turn left,750.56,768.8,272,56,cB-WDXkptWc,1019,https://youtu.be/cB-WDXkptWc?t=750,Critical level: 4 - The situation is not very critical but it requires paying attention to changes in lanes and following traffic lights.
right there yep fine so there's nothing wrong with that especially muddled up between your hands it's okay as long as you don't lose control of the steering,798.959,813.839,156,33,cB-WDXkptWc,1019,https://youtu.be/cB-WDXkptWc?t=798,"Situation: Driving on a straight road with no obstacles or traffic around.

on approach to this roundabout the second exit is straight ahead at 12 o'clock you'd need to start off in the left hand lane on approach as you go forward the left hand lane splits into two and you need to be in the middle as the left one goes left only this is a very big roundabout majority of the traffic on the roundabout simply crosses the dual carriageway going left and right therefore sometimes you have to have a very long wait before you can go in as soon as you move off from this position you need to move straight back to the island on the left-hand side to get back into the left-hand lane to exit the roundabout as sami goes into the roundabout he goes forward into the roundabout as opposed to going around straight into his lane as nobody was on the right as he went forward this was not a serious fault he should also use his left mirror as he goes forward as somebody may be using the left,860.16,910.32,908,192,cB-WDXkptWc,1019,https://youtu.be/cB-WDXkptWc?t=860,"Lane split. 

8 - This is a fairly critical driving situation as the roundabout is big and there is a lot of traffic crossing the dual carriageway, resulting in potentially long waits.

[Music] hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving today's lesson is with lewis now lewis has been driving for how long oh eight months maybe eight months or so but it's been very very on and off so we've only really driven about i think 12 maybe 14 hours in total maybe even under that yeah yeah so today's lesson i want to sort of see how he does everything on his own it's going to be a mixture of roads it's going to be some crossroads some high streets and hazards and mini roundabouts and some big roundabouts in there as well so most of driver i want you to just drive on your own i will just give you directions as normal but i just want to see how you're doing everything on your own okay so when you're ready let's get started,0.83,52.879,739,165,KVtxslBwhRg,1836,https://youtu.be/KVtxslBwhRg?t=0,"3 - The driving situation is somewhat critical as the lesson includes a mixture of different types of roads and hazards, but the instructor is still present and giving directions to the driver."
okay now we're going to be turning left soon so you can use the satellites to see the roads as well on approach to this left turn lewis puts the clutch down and slows down too much but doesn't change gears as he brings the clutch up the car judders as it's too slow in second okay and then turn left again now you don't need the clutch when you make these turns okay if it's sharper then break clutch you can go down to first gear if you like but you don't want to be holding the clutch as you go around the corners a little jelly that you felt on the second to last is because you're in second okay now at the end of this road we're going to turn left okay two things on that one firstly your indicator has switched off yeah you need to put it back on secondly the release on the clutch is a bit fast near the end which is like shut off like that okay okay now the traffic lights we're gonna turn right,77.28,150.08,903,197,KVtxslBwhRg,1836,https://youtu.be/KVtxslBwhRg?t=77,"Criticality: 7 - Lewis's improper use of the clutch and slowing down too much in second gear while approaching the left turn can be dangerous as it can lead to a juddering car, and the situation can turn risky if there is traffic behind the car."
so think about what you want to do on approach all right looking at the size of the junction and the angle of the turn would this be near side or offside um so we're gonna turn when we're halfway or go to the other end of the junction [Music] so it's offside where you go around each other as lewis moves forward into the traffic light junction he should have made sure there was enough space for his vehicle in the junction he moves forward and he's waiting on the crossing he should have waited behind the stop line well they haven't positioned very well um we're in a bit of a tricky spot here we don't have to go forward all the way now so the grey car in front the first one should have gone further yeah just go all the way to the yellow bullet don't turn now we can turn straight away because he's not moving now turn in the left lane when you can check the left mirror aim for that left lane,157.92,221.84,899,193,KVtxslBwhRg,1836,https://youtu.be/KVtxslBwhRg?t=157,"Critical level: 7. 

Lewis is in a traffic light junction with other cars around him and he hasn't positioned his vehicle correctly, creating a potential hazard for himself and others. The situation could quickly escalate if he doesn't take proper precautions."
yeah we should have been trying to aim for a slightly wider turn so we're going to stay here the other lane as you can see goes on the m4 yeah now when we go down to the bottom there there's a roundabout we're going to turn left first exit okay on approach to this roundabout lewis does start breaking and changes down to third gear but doesn't bring the clutch up as the road is downhill because he keeps the clutch down the car's rolling and picking up momentum good get that clutch out get it out it's not helping you there you go okay it's fine leave it in bed clutch out are you done with the clutch yep let go of it all right you've got a bit of that stay in state come back in come back in what's wrong with the left lane why don't you want to be in the left lane yes but why would you want to be on the right one then go back down to second gear when you get a chance and just keep it going,230.4,290.24,898,202,KVtxslBwhRg,1836,https://youtu.be/KVtxslBwhRg?t=230,"Critical: 6 - While the situation is not extremely dangerous, it is moderately critical that the student understands the importance of maintaining control over their vehicle on a downhill slope and properly shifting gears. The instruction to get the clutch out is urgent but not an emergency."
it's the left lanes available and it's free no one's there just stay on the left it's good well done but use your signal if you want to make it clear to them that you're moving over a little bit yeah on approach that round about third gear wasn't the issue it was keeping the clutch down which made you go faster because we're going downhill because when we went slowing down from that 40 miles per hour road we were in i think fourth gear and the first thing you did is you put the clutch down and try changing gears now you did save yourself because you were braking but if you hadn't break the cold have gone even faster but even with the clutch down alone on that downhill gradient you're gonna speed up so just stick to the left lane here the lanes are quite narrow if they're sticking out check the right side mirror wait don't just move over good cause somebody else could be there as well right okay just check the right side mirror,296.0,359.84,940,193,KVtxslBwhRg,1836,https://youtu.be/KVtxslBwhRg?t=296,Criticality: 5 - The situation is moderately critical because the learner is driving in a narrow lane with potential obstacles and needs to be aware of their surroundings before making a lane change.
hold on and select the left lane and keep it going it's green lights hold on i know the first set of traffic lights changed as we were going through but just make sure the other ones are still green which they were with the whole coasting thing you want to try remembering to keep the touchdown for yourself or would you like me to guide you on the next one do you want me to talk you through it or do you want to try it on your own [Music] okay we're going to be going right when we get to the traffic lights ahead so think about what you want to start doing on approach to this right then at the traffic light lewis signals a bit too early he should have waited for the road on the right to pass before signaling the road sort of bears right here is that okay yeah okay so the new speed limit starts at this point we do want to be in third gear because it's a nice straight road driving on a nice straight road you'd,361.68,442.4,918,195,KVtxslBwhRg,1836,https://youtu.be/KVtxslBwhRg?t=361,give it a rating of 2 because the situation is relatively calm and there are no immediate hazards or obstacles.
rather be in the highest gear possible as it's more fuel efficient if there were lots of hazards you'd want to be in a lower gear for more control just keep an eye on that speed it can't be going over that number now break gently go down with the clutch second gear get the clutch out slowly i know we're going to stop and then clutch back down when you get closer change gear so there we didn't have a lot of time to actually bring the clutch out quickly but even that short time the clutch is up it gives you more control over your speed the main hazard on this road is the lorry parked on the right hand side the oncoming vehicles are all overtaking as we get closer if they carry on overtaking we would be required to stop in good time breaking love if they don't stop we will have to go so when you're considering when you have to sort of gear down as well yeah traffic lights were okay yeah we couldn't stop there right should we go down again,443.919,506.479,949,200,KVtxslBwhRg,1836,https://youtu.be/KVtxslBwhRg?t=443,"Critical level: 8 - There are multiple hazards on the road, with oncoming vehicles overtaking and a parked lorry on the right, and the need for the driver to be in lower gears for better control.

yeah get that clutch out slowly better yeah okay [Music] okay so the next time we have to go back down to second gear you want to break from 20 bring your speed down to around 15 or even anything under 20. clutch down change bring the clutch up but keep breaking if you need to take the next road on your left yeah that's the one now think about what we want to do before we turn yeah what about that clutch there you go very nice,507.84,554.16,430,95,KVtxslBwhRg,1836,https://youtu.be/KVtxslBwhRg?t=507,Critical level: 3 - The situation is relatively calm as the driver is practicing downshifting and planning for a left turn.

see that felt so much better yeah it's good lewis positions really well to the left of the center line to make this right turn he leans forward and looks both ways carefully to emerge onto the new road as soon as we turned right into the new road there was a large vehicle approaching you can't continue with the large vehicle as the road is not wide enough for two so you have to wait in a good position yeah that would have been asking for trouble had we carried on there just keep your foot on the brake so we don't roll back really nice gun yeah as you can see here this road wouldn't have supported us with that large vehicle [Music] okay so as you're going along if you see any mini roundabouts or several crossings i want you to say them out loud and also any large vehicles especially when the road is narrow like this just say yeah you see a lorry or you see a bus just because then it'll make it easier,600.88,680.48,912,191,KVtxslBwhRg,1836,https://youtu.be/KVtxslBwhRg?t=600,"Critical level: 8 - The situation is critical because there is a large vehicle approaching on a narrow road, and continuing with the vehicle would have been dangerous.

for you to deal with that hazard then you're more aware that it's there even if it's fun [Music] well done you notice the large vehicle but just deal with them if the road is narrow because he was distracted yeah i don't know i don't know what he was doing there but he was totally distracted all right looking at the signboard [Music] okay now where abouts are we gonna wait so neutral and handbrake switch off the engine so whenever you're waiting at a level crossing yeah i'll switch off the engine yeah so they've actually put some signs up on this one as well which is great and that coasting thing that we talked about made sense why not to sort of keep the clutch down i just need to work on my going down here yeah so what you want to do is if you're at fast speed start braking once you're slow enough throw the clutch in change but get that clutch back out the clutch should only be down for two or three seconds,681.68,761.92,922,199,KVtxslBwhRg,1836,https://youtu.be/KVtxslBwhRg?t=681,"Critical level: 4 - Although there are potential hazards such as the large vehicle and level crossing, they are manageable and the situation is not overly dangerous."
so what are you gonna do when the train passes and the barrier raises that's done mm-hmm day one yep engine on mm-hmm okay good all right let's see if the barrier goes up first there you go and then i'm done,765.839,787.04,207,50,KVtxslBwhRg,1836,https://youtu.be/KVtxslBwhRg?t=765,1 - The driving situation is not critical at all as the car is stationary and there is no traffic around.
the road ahead has parked vehicles on the left-hand side lewis uses his mirrors and moves into the middle allowing enough space for the oncoming traffic to pass but also leaving enough clearance from the parked vehicles on the left [Music] you're dealing nicely with clearance and space around your vehicle with the island and the podcast it's really good with the large vehicle ahead on the right hand side of the road the vehicle in front was waiting but they stopped too late lewis should have gone slower and gone down to first gear to go through as the gap was really narrow good just keep right keep right keep right keep right go slower i know he's sticking out a little bit but if you want to go down to first gear do that okay there's going to be two roundabouts here we're going left at the first one and then right in the second one okay so signal for the first one they're really close together okay [Music] yeah that's one there we go and then,805.36,872.24,956,195,KVtxslBwhRg,1836,https://youtu.be/KVtxslBwhRg?t=805,"Critical level: 6 - The situation with the parked vehicles on the left-hand side requires careful maneuvering and a good sense of space and clearance, but it is manageable with the right precautions."
right at the second one [Music] signal on signal position go and there you go hold on it's just that first one you didn't realize was a roundabout did you okay and also you don't need a signal left to come off because it's um a mini roundabout we're going to up to this a bit later so i'll get to try again so when you say when you see a roundabout you're going to save roundabout so then i know you've seen it louis should have been breaking as this is a downhill gradient and the car will speed up going down,874.079,912.48,510,117,KVtxslBwhRg,1836,https://youtu.be/KVtxslBwhRg?t=874,"Critical level: 6.

okay now keep watching out for large vehicles because they are going to give you trouble down here so i don't want to have any scenarios where we're having to reverse so if we deal with them early that'll be great on narrow country lanes you need to look at the large vehicles as you will get stuck or have to reverse back if you notice the large vehicle too late [Music] should we just stop yep stop then stop your front left higher is very close you've got to just stop with large vehicles yeah good now when you're ready you can move up again just be sure to move that front left away to the right there you go so going down to first gear is good but stopping is just going to make it so much easier hold on so there's a bit more space on that one maybe lean forward if you can't see around the corners yeah there you go there is notices of traffic lights and slows down and stops in a good position this is a pelican traffic light where,929.519,1004.16,940,198,KVtxslBwhRg,1836,https://youtu.be/KVtxslBwhRg?t=929,"Critical level: 4 - While it is important to be cautious of large vehicles on narrow country lanes, the situation is not extremely critical as long as the driver is aware of their surroundings and takes appropriate action."
the flashing amber light turns on after red if the flashing amber is on but there are no pedestrians crossing you should carry on lewis keeps on waiting until the lights go back to green the traffic on the opposite side has started this can go down as a serious fault if you don't move in time should we go where can we go yeah we can go and it's flashing amber as nobody's actually crossing which is why the other side was flowing so that was a pelican traffic light what's that in front of us [Music] but they've pushed that left-hand edge out so that it forces you to go in and slow down lois deals with the hazard really well by slowing down in good time good pretty well done i'm glad you did that i thought you would have had more trouble there although we had priority if they keep pushing we'll have to just stop by turn right at the lights make sure there's no turns before the one you're taking [Music],1005.839,1107.93,912,194,KVtxslBwhRg,1836,https://youtu.be/KVtxslBwhRg?t=1005,"Critical level: 4 - While the situation is not very critical, there is still some level of danger as it involves traffic lights and potential hazards, such as pedestrians.

turn right [Music] take note of the signs on entry this road is not suitable for wide vehicles if anyone approaches a head they would have priority as the part vehicles are on the left hand side of the road you need to keep scanning the road in the distance to make sure there are no oncoming vehicles as you may have to give way suddenly once you've committed and there are no passing places you'd have to continue the oncoming vehicles can also give way on the right,1132.88,1179.52,468,95,KVtxslBwhRg,1836,https://youtu.be/KVtxslBwhRg?t=1132,"Critical level: 8 - It is a narrow road with oncoming traffic, and there are no passing places.

really well done you did really nicely on that road there along these roads you have to really be looking in the distance and planning ahead yeah if you can pull in and park up on the left just ahead of this silver car i'll just break clutch from now really slow it down as the space isn't very big that's it and gradually move it away move it away a bit more and then straighten up that's great there thank you okay brilliant how's it going been good thanks yeah so you see why it was so important to identify those large vehicles on those roads because it was just so narrow if you had gone any further especially with the yellow one we would have got stuck and then the green lorry coming through again you saw him really nice and you sort of just stopped there i know you wanted to just go into first gear and keep rolling yeah but it makes it very hard for him to judge the space next to you as well so this stuffing was the best thing there,1204.24,1264.08,946,195,KVtxslBwhRg,1836,https://youtu.be/KVtxslBwhRg?t=1204,"Criticality: 6 - The driving situation is moderately critical.

lewis deals with the cyclists really well by overtaking using his mirrors leaving lots of clearance making sure he doesn't cut back in in front of the cyclist you dealt with himself [Music] um if you want to make it clear but it was all right there's enough space following the road yeah so with that i wouldn't say anything the examiners would be the same in the test but just as there are parked vehicles on the right hand side of the road lewis moves its position far to the left so that the middle of the road is available for the oncoming vehicles,1655.279,1703.44,552,115,KVtxslBwhRg,1836,https://youtu.be/KVtxslBwhRg?t=1655,"Critical level: 2. 
The situation is not very critical as the instructor mentions that Lewis deals with the cyclists well and there is enough space on the road. However, Lewis moves his position to allow for oncoming vehicles, which is good to avoid potential accidents."
[Music] leading up to the double bend ahead lewis leans forward to look around the corner as it is a very sharp bend doing this makes it easier to identify any oncoming vehicles around the bends you did really well with the bends there leaning forward makes a massive difference try and avoid big potholes and dips in the road if you can kind of avoid them safely straight on so whenever i need you to turn i'll tell you you did really well you were definitely looking around the bends a lot more which is great we just didn't have any large vehicles suddenly turned up so right we tried but you know you were definitely being more proactive that time you were being more prepared looking in case somebody was there rather than just reacting to them if they suddenly turn out,1722.67,1793.12,775,152,KVtxslBwhRg,1836,https://youtu.be/KVtxslBwhRg?t=1722,"Critical level: 6 - While the situation is not extremely critical, the double bend and potential oncoming vehicles around the bend require a heightened level of alertness and cautiousness."
so yeah i hope you guys enjoyed today's video where you got to learn a lot about how to deal with large vehicles narrow roads and a level crossing as well how do you think you did all right i guess there's better no more one on the card but yeah but it's okay you've got to make mistakes to learn from them don't you yeah but yeah well done thank you very much,1812.799,1834.279,360,79,KVtxslBwhRg,1836,https://youtu.be/KVtxslBwhRg?t=1812,0 - The driving situation is not critical at all as the video is just a summary of a lesson and there is no actual driving involved.
[Music] hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving today i'm doing a lesson for matthew now matthew has his test coming up in two days time i am doing the lesson in his car so i don't have the controls on my side um if anything happens i can't really do much besides tell you to stop okay so he hasn't driven in this area before so today's lesson is just to get a nice little introduction on all the different little junctions making sure that you're driving safely yeah just get familiar with the area a little bit so whenever you're ready we're gonna get started [Music] okay so we're gonna follow signs to slow from here all right,0.0,57.84,636,138,S6S4yi6900E,2345,https://youtu.be/S6S4yi6900E?t=0,Critical level: 3 - The driving situation is not very critical as the focus is on familiarizing the student with the area and getting an introduction to different junctions.
i just put that signal on slightly earlier about six to eight columns away have it on so a lot of the roads around here like this we're just driving out in the country yeah we had that national sign as we entered oh does that apply that one yeah all right as in oh yeah we had another sign just here oh i did not see that yeah um but yeah no streetlamps so i should be going if it's safe to drive at 60 drive at 60 at the moment it's probably only safe let's say 40 yeah yeah so as long as you're not driving 20 you'll be fine okay driving down country lanes always look out for road signs as they may be hidden behind trees and bushes do as best as you can the signs are partly sort of hidden because of the trees overgrown so you've got to keep looking out for signs now there's your new speed limit coming in again partly hidden,75.04,165.84,831,185,S6S4yi6900E,2345,https://youtu.be/S6S4yi6900E?t=75,"Criticality: 3.

yeah these birds are so bad especially in a small car a good combination okay the sign board's slightly covered up again but slow is straight ahead there are two roundabouts all right so it's like a right left okay there's lots of ropes to consider what should we do for the first bit so it's just up there yeah that's the way we heard i'm keeping on that second car because his signal's hidden isn't it,181.84,223.68,403,86,S6S4yi6900E,2345,https://youtu.be/S6S4yi6900E?t=181,"Criticality: 5 - The situation is somewhat critical as there are two roundabouts and the signboard is slightly covered up, but the instructor and student are discussing and taking necessary precautions."
good well done but you could have used a left indicator to make it clear on this one yeah even on the first one we could have used the right so what do you think the speed is on this road this will be 30. yeah we've got street lamps and no signs,244.56,263.199,245,56,S6S4yi6900E,2345,https://youtu.be/S6S4yi6900E?t=244,"Critical level: 3.

you need to keep an eye on the speed when it changes because it can't default you know yeah yeah it doesn't it started back there oh really yeah every time you see the speed signs changing i want you to say it out loud so i know that you know all right okay okay now from here is actually straight ahead i don't know if you saw the signboard i did the roundabout one yeah so which lane goes straight ahead okay but we should have been in the left one this one's okay as well no signal so you've got to stick to the lane you're in now because we can't change as we enter and then what do we do at this point now yep you do yeah but that's works out here sometimes oh i see right down that road yeah okay now speed then it's losing 40 now is it safe to drive at 60 on this road yes so it's the next road on the left so you can see the full east side,281.12,365.039,847,195,S6S4yi6900E,2345,https://youtu.be/S6S4yi6900E?t=281,"Critical level: 4.

[Music] okay good so again 30 is the maximum doesn't mean you need to drive it 30 it's on roads like this what type of typical hazards would you expect animals bikers horses maybe runners in the road because there's no footpath on this side yeah what about tractors and things like that yeah all the countryside yeah horses you've got to really be looking out around here now oh my god every single sign is covered yeah it's just okay it's just right there yeah there was a sign saying pedestrians maybe in the road,384.44,445.52,515,109,S6S4yi6900E,2345,https://youtu.be/S6S4yi6900E?t=384,"Critical level: 5 - While there are hazards to be aware of such as animals and pedestrians, the driving situation is not yet extremely critical."
this is a narrow country lane where there are various hazards and traffic calming measures to slow traffic down so as you can see here this road has no street lamps but they have put 30 signs continuous because if they didn't have those signs everyone would think it's national yeah 60. i want to say it probably was a national before always step off the accelerator leading into sharp bends around country lanes [Music] what's that sign mean that one yeah it means that this they merge yeah the road narrows on both sides good mirror check that there is a hazard line painted throughout most of this road a hazard line is a long white line with a small gap in between on this road the main hazards are the bends and the hidden entrances,464.16,546.839,737,146,S6S4yi6900E,2345,https://youtu.be/S6S4yi6900E?t=464,"8 - The driving situation on this narrow country lane is quite critical due to various hazards, traffic calming measures, hidden entrances, and sharp bends.

matthew should have been driving slower as there is a sharp bend ahead the hedge on the left is overgrown into the road and as you can see most vehicles have been shaving past the hedge to really tighten that horn and just take it even slower,565.519,581.76,242,49,S6S4yi6900E,2345,https://youtu.be/S6S4yi6900E?t=565,"Critical level: 8 - There is a sharp bend ahead and the overgrown hedge on the left is forcing most vehicles to shave past it, requiring tighter control and slower speed."
through the priority section the hazard line disappears as the road is only wide enough for one vehicle at a time the bridge ahead is traffic light controlled the road is not wide enough for two vehicles to pass at the same time as the lights go green you need to position your vehicle in the middle of the road and move back to the left only once you get to the other side the hazard line disappears on approach to the bridge okay but you should have positioned yourself in the middle we're hitting the branches there aren't we yeah because this is now one way when the lights go green they have red yeah that makes sense so you can take up the whole room yeah that was all fun about traffic light otherwise they would have just had no light there that accents did you not think the road was a bit narrow i i did and i thought it was a pretty small bridge for two cars which is why i tried to stay to the left as much as i could okay,599.12,660.16,934,189,S6S4yi6900E,2345,https://youtu.be/S6S4yi6900E?t=599,"Critical level: 8 - The driving situation is critical because the road is narrow and the bridge is only wide enough for one vehicle at a time, which requires careful positioning when the traffic lights turn green."
yeah that was a humpback bruce they usually have them traffic light controlled okay like here sorry just in the middle there's no white line but back there there was so this section is only wide enough for one just there you go he's stopped just really take your time with it because they've stopped a bit late hold on so these are all traffic calming measures so you'll see the white line painted as soon as the road is wide enough for two okay and if it's not you gotta assume there's well the line they've cut off the line in those points haven't they yeah there have been signs in between this is a warning sign of a stop junction in 50 yards you would only get this warning sign as the junction is hard to see on approach turn left good so this is a complete stop on this one matthew look both ways just the same okay i know it's just the right that you mainly want to be looking but what if somebody on the left turns in badly,663.04,719.76,932,198,S6S4yi6900E,2345,https://youtu.be/S6S4yi6900E?t=663,"Criticality: 8 - The driving situation is critical due to the presence of multiple traffic calming measures and a warning sign for a stop junction, requiring the driver's full attention and caution."
and the other thing was for that left turn go around that corner a bit more to have a better angle to come up of this road yeah and then you can probably see a bit further if you're out that angle yeah okay okay so what's the speed down here then this is okay we're going to now go apart some of the trickier junctions in the area,722.32,749.44,330,74,S6S4yi6900E,2345,https://youtu.be/S6S4yi6900E?t=722,"Critical level: 3 - The situation is not very critical as they are discussing a strategy for a safer turn, but they do mention going to some trickier junctions later on."
you know you could have gone there right yeah okay because he was blocked off yeah so that would be counted as a minor fault for hesitation there because when we initially got there everyone in front was just going straight yeah and this guy wasn't actually at the roundabout so i still want you to tell me when the speed limit changes we're going to go left when we get to the end think about what you need to do on approach good make sure it's running all the way through until you've made the turn 20 now,777.12,825.279,507,105,S6S4yi6900E,2345,https://youtu.be/S6S4yi6900E?t=777,"2 - The driving situation is not critical at all.

okay now on the next round about approach i want this break to be a bit smoother because i feel like you're breaking a bit late and heavy to break lighter give the person behind more time to react where am i going just following the road ahead for now even when we get to the roundabout you remember the double roundabout we did earlier yeah we're coming back to that all right from a different angle then okay good but you want to be slowing down before that sign before yeah so as you pass a sign your speed should be around 30. okay okay so around first one left second one right it's like the road ahead on this type of roundabout we're following the road ahead you don't need a signal but it does make it very clear to others where you're going nicely done what were they doing i had privacy you did have priority there it's just he's been a bit silly you dealt really nicely so even if someone else does something wrong as long as you deal with it safely,1219.6,1299.52,960,200,S6S4yi6900E,2345,https://youtu.be/S6S4yi6900E?t=1219,"Critical level: 4 - While the situation requires attention and adjustment, it is not overly urgent or dangerous.

it won't be marked down but you won't be marked down for that all right so if it's not my fault and i just react to it well yeah that's what you should be doing yeah so again the road ahead is more right oh sorry i'm very on now good but yeah you should have been on the right the guy behind the same thing he came into the same lane as you so it's not an issue but he could have very easily positioned on the right yeah and then okay now looking at the diagram in the distance i want to say signs to slough all right i'm guessing on this one but i think it is yes to the left okay matthew deals with the two cyclists ahead really well but keeping his distance as the roundabout is coming up from the diagram you can see slow is a left turn at the first roundabout and straight at the second one so what should we do if we're turning left good but this signal i don't want to have to keep reminding you yes,1301.84,1372.84,906,201,S6S4yi6900E,2345,https://youtu.be/S6S4yi6900E?t=1301,4 - The driving situation is not very critical as the instructor is providing feedback on minor mistakes made by the learner driver.
good matthew didn't notice this was a roundabout and carries on straight without looking matthew did you look right on that roundabout the this right here when we did yeah not not the first one but the second one no i saw the stop lights and i just went straight ahead okay you should have looked right there was a car on your right but he was going left okay but if you completely miss a roundabout and you do not look right you will get a serious fault for that okay you know when i showed you the signs for slough did you know there were two roundabouts i saw two on the sign yeah but i thought they were i was in the left one already okay so the first roundabout was a left turn wasn't it yeah okay and the second round about was a straight so you still need you just needed to look across to the right that's that was it okay now when we get to the next roundabout we're gonna take the second exit,1379.28,1442.84,902,194,S6S4yi6900E,2345,https://youtu.be/S6S4yi6900E?t=1379,"Critical level: 7.

does a roundabout signal make sense when to signal right when if you're going anywhere but straight on you need a signal entering or like second exit so anything past 12 you'd signal right to begin and left to exit yeah and if it's the first one you signal left on approach and if the second before 12 you just signal when you fix it yeah that's it okay we're gonna do two turns really close together at the first one we're gonna go left at the roundabout and then immediately after it's a right turn so it's the left of the roundabout and then a right turn,1551.6,1584.559,557,121,S6S4yi6900E,2345,https://youtu.be/S6S4yi6900E?t=1551,"Critical level: 6 - The situation is somewhat critical because the learner driver is about to make two turns back to back in a short duration, and it requires quick decision-making skills."

yeah they both go straight but in the distance on the left there are part vehicles so it makes sense to yeah avoid them if you notice that quite early on you can just move right early because that's just good awareness and planning so what would be the speed limit here i want to say there's space for one more ahead of them [Music] hold on there are two separate traffic lights on this junction one for going ahead and one for going right the traffic light for going ahead is green but it's just harder to see if this traffic light goes red whilst you're going through you should not stop here as there is no solid line this traffic light only applies to traffic behind the stop line we're going to follow the road ahead to follow the road ahead simply use your mirrors towards the right and move into the middle lane you can signal to make it clear should i have indicated there yeah i was going to say yeah using mirrors that indicate everyone will be moving over at the same point,2059.04,2157.119,984,195,S6S4yi6900E,2345,https://youtu.be/S6S4yi6900E?t=2059,"Critical level: 4.

so on approach to zebra crossings always step off the accelerator and scan both sides of the road for any pedestrians that may want to cross the road with cyclists on the pavement be wary as they may ride into the road they should come off the bicycle and walk across the road but sometimes they may just come into the road straight away you're just heading straight from here,140.84,178.64,376,72,gjmV0PJwtsk,1556,https://youtu.be/gjmV0PJwtsk?t=140,"Critical level: 6 - While not a highly critical situation, it is important to be vigilant and cautious of potential hazards, such as pedestrians and cyclists, when approaching a zebra crossing."

in a road with park vehicles on both sides if the middle of the road is not wide enough for two cars always position your vehicle in the center of the road matthew positions his vehicle really well going round the bend leading up to this white car he should have moved back into the middle of the road a little bit earlier as the road is only wide enough for one in the center,221.2,243.04,376,76,gjmV0PJwtsk,1556,https://youtu.be/gjmV0PJwtsk?t=221,"Criticality: 8 - The situation is quite critical as the road is narrow and there are parked cars on both sides, which leaves little space for two cars to pass.

matthew slows down really well to give way to the oncoming vehicles every time you give way and then you move back into the road you should always check your mirrors as motorbikes and cyclists may try to overtake there is a width restriction ahead matthew slows down really well and positions over to the left to park and slowly goes through that space if you were driving a manual car you'd usually select first gear at this point to give you more control thank you pull over and park up on the left anywhere safe okay,260.16,308.96,519,104,gjmV0PJwtsk,1556,https://youtu.be/gjmV0PJwtsk?t=260,"Criticality level: 4 - The situation is not very critical as the driving is smooth, but there is a width restriction ahead and awareness of potential motorbikes and cyclists overtaking is important."
you can pull over and park on the right hand side of the road don't worry about the driveways on this occasion that's great though thank you so what i'd like you to do now is to reverse back for about two car lengths keeping reasonably close to and parallel with the pavement as you do this before starting to reverse always look around starting from your left all the way over to your right blind spot to make sure there's nobody around you if anyone turns up whilst you're reversing wait for them to pass until it's safe to continue the black car ahead wasn't too close to us so it wasn't necessary to stop for them if any pedestrians turn up and they're close to your vehicle or they're crossing behind the car be sure to stop while reversing keep the vehicle nice and slow and go in a nice straight line until you've done about two car lengths thank you drive often are you ready,338.08,393.36,883,180,gjmV0PJwtsk,1556,https://youtu.be/gjmV0PJwtsk?t=338,6 - The situation is moderately critical as the learner is expected to reverse on the road and needs to be aware of blind spots and pedestrians.

as matthew goes round the roundabout he uses his mirrors towards the left to move back into the left lane to exit the roundabout with the independent drive always look out for sign boards so that you can see the direction that you're headed and get into position in good time going the wrong way is not a serious fault but you want to have good awareness and planning,649.839,676.64,367,73,gjmV0PJwtsk,1556,https://youtu.be/gjmV0PJwtsk?t=649,"Critical level: 5.

um that right turn nearly had you though do you remember which one there was a right turn where you stopped but it was such a sharp late stop not really no there was there was a right town we were doing and you nearly overshot the turn you know oh yes yes in the box junction yeah or not box but there was uh there's a little bit of space but not quite enough for the size of your car but you did wait the you there was enough space that cars were still able to continue but you should have tried to just approach a little bit slower okay this is the concern that i had sort of yesterday making sure that you're slowing down enough for your turns and not sort of wait until the last minute to break okay so you should have been approaching slower on that one because i thought you'd end up past the junction on that one yeah the emergency stop was good but after the emergency stop you didn't look over your left blind spot you kind of looked in your left mirror and over to,1463.44,1513.76,974,200,gjmV0PJwtsk,1556,https://youtu.be/gjmV0PJwtsk?t=1463,"Critical level: 6 - The situation is not extremely critical, but the student's lack of awareness and caution during turns could potentially lead to accidents, especially in busy traffic areas."
the right fully okay but you should sort of check over both sides so if anything you'd get a minor on that one because you're not looking everywhere yeah yeah okay yeah it's a shame about that crossing honestly it would have been a past if it wasn't for that but this is something to be really mindful of okay because it there is a um station by that point and then there's loads of shops so people do cross yeah yeah it's frequent and that's why it's a 20 that section okay so that's the end of today's test i hope you guys enjoyed that video and learnt some tips from how matthew drives because he does drive quite well but unfortunately he didn't see the pedestrian on the crossing okay,1515.279,1554.76,689,145,gjmV0PJwtsk,1556,https://youtu.be/gjmV0PJwtsk?t=1515,"7 - The situation is critical due to the presence of a frequent pedestrian crossing near a station and shops, which requires the driver to be extremely careful and mindful of their surroundings."
[Music] hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving today is matthews test in about half an hour's time how are you feeling pretty good okay good good so we've been working on a few things already and we're just going to go for a nice 10-15 minute drive and work our way towards the test center okay so whenever you're ready let's get started we had loads of confusing roads up until now should be a little bit easier now hopefully,0.06,42.879,433,95,TihXo5LC5uU,850,https://youtu.be/TihXo5LC5uU?t=0,3 - The driving situation is not critical at all as they are just going for a 10-15 minute drive to the test center.
the view from the right hand side of the road is obscured with the hedges on the right so matthew leans forward to get a better view the traffic on the new road is moving at 30 miles per hour matthew does have a few gaps approaching from the right hand side but the left hand side of the road is busy so he keeps waiting until there's a safe gap on both sides before emerging first entrance on the left into the car park just here [Music] and then we'll turn right just in here okay matthew if you can forward park into any space entirely your choice just finish within the white lines okay when forward parking always try and start away from the side that you wish to park so that you have more space to go ahead and adjust your position before reversing at any time always look around from your left to your right blind spot as well as looking out the back window [Music] in any maneuver if you do have to readjust it will get counted down as a minor fault,71.68,150.08,958,200,TihXo5LC5uU,850,https://youtu.be/TihXo5LC5uU?t=71,"Critical level: 3 - While the view is obscured, traffic is moving at a relatively slow speed and Matthew has some gaps to work with.

so that man and the little girl were also a hazard and we'd have to watch out for her yeah when driving on the main road watch out for the crossroads as vehicles from the sides sometimes come out really quickly as they're just crossing your path well they really didn't respect that stop junction so we're just heading back to the test center now so just a little quick overview for you get around about we're gonna go straight,611.68,643.279,427,86,TihXo5LC5uU,850,https://youtu.be/TihXo5LC5uU?t=611,"Criticality: 6 - There are multiple hazards mentioned in this fragment, including a man and a little girl and vehicles coming out quickly at crossroads.

as you went round you know you're following a4 yeah you've gone to the one that says four or six yeah so you went into the wrong lane yeah and then as you're now in the wrong lane i didn't say anything the exit's coming up you've seen that's the exit you've checked your mirror's signal but the lady behind she's now in position to take the exit and you're moving in front of her so they're exactly where i checked the mirrors and you had to like yeah it's a white collar yeah so the lady hooted us but she was okay with it she left dealt with it safely but yeah we're now in position to take the next exit the position she's in she can take that exit but she could also come round so that's why it's dangerous because now you're switching at the point that she could have been going to the other one yeah yeah yeah so that's the first issue on the a4 there,2356.64,2394.72,857,194,GE864yZXS7I,2790,https://youtu.be/GE864yZXS7I?t=2356,I would rate the driving situation as a 7 because the driver is in the wrong lane and is potentially endangering the driver behind them by cutting them off at the exit point.
then along the a4 you were driving in the lane that says a4 yeah as we went forward it was initially it was the only normal driving lane yeah but then as we went forward it went into two a4 yeah yeah you then went on to the far right yeah why did you move on the right because we were going straight yes but what's wrong with the left one there's nothing wrong to be honest yes okay so that is the lead up to the next mistake so both lanes went straight there was nothing wrong with you moving into the right but the left was available you should have carried on there now as you went into that roundabout where we were just going straight you noticed the trouble everyone in your lane was turning right yeah you now had to swerve around them so i should have stayed to the left you should have stayed in that lane yeah so that lane did go straight but if someone in your lane is turning just stop in in your path don't try and swerve because now you're disturbing,2396.0,2446.4,964,201,GE864yZXS7I,2790,https://youtu.be/GE864yZXS7I?t=2396,"Criticality: 7 - The situation became critical when the learner had to swerve around the cars turning right, which could have led to an accident."

right it's just the left hand side was a little bit off which i i noticed that most often with anyone that's been driving like experienced drivers because you're closer to the right you'll check that one away whereas the left you don't check it as much but the reason you want to check the left as much this much is because more driving on these 20 roads cyclists so many cyclists cyclists cyclists motorbikes they turn up very quickly don't they and yeah they can just come up and through any small gap and they'll be through so that's why these left mirror checks were sort of vital in places yeah oh another thing i remembered um do you remember when we were waiting on the other road parked up and there was a bit of traffic behind us and you'd signal to move off and then that motorbike gave you away yeah so with that there was traffic flowing you've signaled to go which is fine but when they're when there's traffic flowing,2422.88,2468.48,931,191,qMWUh6b43tE,2638,https://youtu.be/qMWUh6b43tE?t=2422,"Critical level: 8.

be prepared to go if you want to move in front of them so what happened there is the motorbike gave you way and you were like oh wait he's giving me away so if you're signaling he's they're most likely to give way and if they do you've got to be ready to go but you dealt with that fairly quickly so again no issues but be prepared if you can see this traffic and you don't really want to go before them just wait for your signal put it on when you want to go okay that's good yeah let's go work on some of these things and yes all right so one last mistake that i wanted to talk about and that was the traffic light right turn yes so um with that one when the lights were green the traffic in front of you moved but we could see the bus and the new road wasn't moving so there's no point of us going forward so what happened there is you've gone past past the stop line and after that there's a cycle box and a crossing box,2470.079,2516.16,924,205,qMWUh6b43tE,2638,https://youtu.be/qMWUh6b43tE?t=2470,"Critical level: 8 - The situation at the traffic light right turn could potentially be dangerous as there was a cycle box and a crossing box after the stop line, and the traffic ahead was not moving."

earlier was you were looking right and just you've seen someone there and then you're just waiting yeah but now on the next last few attempts that we've had you've definitely been looking both ways and taking that opportunity so it's not as if you need to change anything about your drive just make sure it's safe and just go with it and so some of the gaps that you're taking if you're not sure and you feel like yeah i can take it just take it a bit quicker so that you don't slow them down okay okay um is there anything else that you wanted to go over yeah how are the big round about snell that was good that was good yeah now you did well in the line that's it that's it yeah so remember going the wrong way not a problem yeah um yeah i think that's more or less everything and the maneuver as well oh the the parking yeah so you get why you have to look around yeah a lot of them a lot of locks doing like the checks all around,2563.52,2612.96,934,204,qMWUh6b43tE,2638,https://youtu.be/qMWUh6b43tE?t=2563,"2 - The situation is not very critical, as the learner driver is doing well in looking both ways and taking gaps when safe, and there are no immediate obstacles or hazards mentioned."
yeah anytime you change direction so if you've now reversed and you think all that back tire is touching or it's too close just pop it in first look behind and then take that step forward rather than just sort of using that mirror because that mirror doesn't cover that blind spot which is what we were talking about okay so that's the end of today's mock test i hope you guys enjoyed that video,2614.24,2631.04,395,80,qMWUh6b43tE,2638,https://youtu.be/qMWUh6b43tE?t=2614,"Criticality: 2.

[Music] do [Music] hi guys and welcome back to clevy driving today i'm doing another driving lesson for eloise and in today's lesson we are working on big roundabouts and a little bit of engine break as well okay so when we first start i will be doing a talk through on the first two or three and then after that i'm gonna hopefully cut down my instruction and have you doing them on your own yeah so we have done big roundabouts but just not too much in this area so it's just to get used to these roundabouts a little bit so when you're ready let's get started,0.1,44.96,562,126,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=0,Critical Level: 2 - The situation is not critical at all as it is just a regular driving lesson practicing big roundabouts and engine breaking.
so we're gonna go left at the end here,70.4,70.4,38,10,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=70,Criticality level: 3 - The situation is not very critical as the instruction is simple and there aren't any apparent obstacles or hazards.
okay just try and get yourself around to that corner a bit more brilliant okay so on this first round about we're going to turn right that exit thinking about the approach good start breaking a little bit but watch the right and ahead can we go yeah yeah nice and quick [Music] good it's really important to count the english as you're going around it makes it so much easier to know where you're positioning so looking on your right you know what you're doing good so you're going straight towards the island at an angle right good mirror check there yep really nice position yeah you just have to sit at an angle i know this probably feels so unnatural it does i know that doesn't seem like much but if it came into the road that would be a bigger concern good all right now we're going to be switching into the right lane when safe so think about what you want to do for this good also keep an eye on that top mirror to get a good distance,86.799,173.76,942,194,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=86,"Critical level: 6 - The situation is somewhat critical as the learner driver is approaching a roundabout, and needs to position the car accurately while making sure to observe the surroundings to avoid any potential risks."
leave it running all right so on the slowing down part make sure that speed comes down so break as much as you need get it down to about 20 and then good okay now can we move into or do you need one okay use the accelerator then watch the roundabout and the right look ahead look right how's it looking good nice and quick then counting the exit so there's one okay good but make sure you're looking at the traffic ahead here as well so at this point we should be more towards the right but there's island two in front so as soon as they go we go towards the island so check the left mirror here and go towards the island and round and keep up that momentum at this point and single left there you go now we're in that ideal position for these guys to enter because they know you're leaving does that feel better yeah that was better okay now the traffic lights turn right [Music] doing now think about the gear change and when you want to do it,176.8,262.72,945,198,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=176,I would give this situation a 7 because they are approaching a roundabout and need to be aware of other vehicles and decide when to enter. There is also traffic ahead that they need to be mindful of.
get that clutch out come on good now braking have a look around yes or no yeah yeah so it's straight away good good but that gear change you're leaving it too late you're just having more to do at the junction [Music] good break as much as you can here so that we don't have to stop when we get there okay how about with the gear change try and do it three car lengths before the traffic lights or before that junction just give yourself a distance but yeah i want to have it done by this point [Music] okay so what we're gonna do now the roundabout is go straight on okay no not right this time so we're taking the second exit so looking at the road marking yeah what are you gonna do with that gear changer louise [Music] back clutch out come on you can put it back down later good and fast gear you keep forgetting the gears and once once i was when i did remind you about the gear try and use the,267.44,348.32,900,196,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=267,Number 6 - The driving situation is not very critical at this moment as the learner driver is simply practicing gear changes and navigating a roundabout.
brakes that you're giving yourself more time for the gauge range okay so from here this time is it safe to enter um yeah yeah lots of acceleration and go straight towards the island so using the mirror brilliant good what should we do at this point um signal signal that we're leaving and check that right mirror as you exit because that class has come out from there now as we're in the left lane we do have priority over the exit we'll turn that indicator off now looking at the traffic lights we're going ahead [Music] you see that lori's just come out we're gonna go right in there so the black car's going now okay so with the roundabouts the approach you need to be breaking giving yourself that time you're scared of breaking you're scared of changing gears and bringing that clutch out go left here go into that corner a bit more and get ready straight away can we take it how many cars okay good looking left as well okay so we're going straight on from here,349.6,440.08,967,199,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=349,"I would rate the driving situation in this fragment as a 7 out of 10, as there are multiple potential hazards on the road, such as the need to brake and give oneself more time, the presence of a roundabout, and the need to check mirrors and signal intentions."
all right on the roundabout this time we're gonna turn right third exit so again you can see that's that sharp turn again so that means straight after tricking them we want to be on the left already yeah and you know that's a dual carriageway uh-huh so it will naturally put you in the overtaking lane wouldn't it yeah use the accelerator especially when we're on the bigger roads okay all right so taking the third exit right what should we do on an approach start positioning more towards the right even if you can't go into that lane straight away okay because when it opens up you can go straight forward if it's too narrow don't keep going through if you're not sure okay it is fine but just if you're not comfortable with it don't go just because he's gone through okay so do you want to try the position on your own yeah yeah so you know at what point you should be moving over and the mirror checks and everything else yeah good,446.24,516.0,936,198,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=446,"6 - The driving situation is moderately critical. Turning right on a roundabout with a sharp turn and positioning towards the right while on a dual carriageway could require careful maneuvering and potential merging with other vehicles. The instructor also emphasizes the importance of using the accelerator on bigger roads, which can add to the challenge."
as the traffic lights go green you should look across to the right and enter the roundabout the traffic in the roundabout would now have a red light eloise starts waiting for the traffic on the roundabout as if it was a giveaway roundabout this holds up the traffic behind her this would go down as a serious fault remember it's traffic light controlled yes let's go come on go go go it's traffic light control the roundabout he's got a red light hasn't he yeah okay yeah and then what do we do brilliant get that steering wheel,518.24,554.64,528,110,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=518,"Critical level: 8

Eloise's mistake of waiting at a traffic light-controlled roundabout as if it was a giveaway roundabout caused serious traffic buildup and posed a high risk of accidents."
okay when you saw the lights go green why did you expect them to come through i just got indicated i got stressed okay so they were doing what we did earlier just going into that position yeah excuse me it's okay so when the lights go green look right definitely but they shouldn't be coming through so it's only if they look like they're going through red okay so on approach to the next roundabout do you want to try slowing down and gearing down on your own yeah i'll try yeah so what speed are you going to go down to bed and what speed are you going to go down to second to 20 and you're going to watch your speed to make sure the numbers are down right okay okay so on this next round valve we're taking the second exit straight if there are ahead lights if the traffic lights are green as you get there you can do the roundabout in third you just don't want to do it in fourth it's a bit too fast,574.0,637.519,903,194,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=574,"Critical level: 3. 

The situation is not particularly critical, but there are some potential hazards to be aware of, such as paying attention to the traffic lights and being cautious when approaching the roundabout."
when looking at the roundabout diagram always look at the angle of your turn to be prepared for how you should position in the roundabout now look at the road marking get that clutch out and get it out again all the way there you go okay so now from here which lane is yours there yeah so check the mirror and bit quicker to go in remember it's traffic light control to the left to the left you said yes go quicker now i know you didn't mean to go into that lane yeah yeah go quicker although eloise did check her mirrors before moving to the right there was a vehicle on the right that was affected by her so that would go down as a dangerous fault the left-hand lane on this roundabout was going left only so the middle lane would still be the left-hand lane in the roundabout as soon as you enter the roundabout you need to check your mirror across to the left and go into the first lane at the traffic lights all right we're going to take the exit,639.36,717.44,951,199,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=639,"Criticality: 8. 

Eloise made a dangerous fault by not being aware of the vehicle on the right which was affected by her, and if this had not been pointed out it could have led to a collision. Additionally, the traffic light control and lane changes required a higher level of attention and quick response."
here to come off at heathrow so what should we do to come off okay now as you come off i want you to keep right always avoid puddles you want to get your brakes wet um all right on the roundabout we're taking the fourth exit towards heathrow do you wanna try slowing and gearing down on your own again yeah yeah so right signal on and then work on the slowing down part always give yourself more time do a block change this time yeah and then get ready to look first have a look nice and quick count on the exits once you're in stay right what exit have we just passed two then why are we moving left yeah we wait for the third one now check left [Music] good just breaking as you're going into that corner okay just really tuck it in okay we'll talk about that in a minute okay we're just going to do a right turn soon so when safe if you could move into the right hand lane that's great yeah,718.56,815.68,893,196,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=718,"Critical level: 5 - There are some important instructions being given for navigating a roundabout and changing lanes, but the situation is not overly intense or dangerous."
so what you want to do is just break move in after him what happened on the roundabout after you entered uh you looked like you were trying to move into the left after second yeah go behind the yellow bar okay what i want you to do is count out loud it makes life so much easier okay now as you're approaching look in that mirror and lean forward towards the steering wheel lean forward as far as you can see it you can see the bus now can't you yeah how many before the bus or after the bus cyclist yeah okay so if you look ahead there's traffic ahead in there so after the cyclist right foot in position lean forward a bit more so you can really cover both both lanes you can turn around because you're stationary but if you just lean forward it opens up that blind spot completely you want to overtake him now so use your mirrors i would do this as early as possible because you don't want to get stuck good now check it left,817.92,874.24,928,192,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=817,6 - The situation is somewhat critical as the learner driver is approaching a roundabout with multiple vehicles around and has to make a decision on overtaking a cyclist.
again he's going to catch up so you're going to use your mirrors move around safely and then move left one safe okay is it clear yeah go really quickly there brilliant man good check your mirrors and come back in now that bus should be gone by the time we get there because there's no more passengers getting on and off now there's a roundabout in here deluise what should we do for the roundabout slow down fellas here and do a second good now we're taking the third exit it's that 12 o'clock so you can still be in the left lane okay so there's no road locking third now look across to the right and look ahead look across the head good yeah okay now follow your lane and count out loud [Music] yeah this guy really didn't position very well what do we do here at two good there we are was that better yeah counting out loud definitely helped [Music] okay so now we're gonna be doing a right turn at those lights okay,880.079,954.88,919,199,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=880,"The driving situation is around a 4, as there are some potential obstacles like the roundabout and poorly positioned vehicle, but the instructor is reminding the student to check their mirrors and move safely."
okay now on the roundabout we're gonna take the third exit right towards central london and richmond so what should we do yeah brilliant get into position now think about the speed and the gear everything we've been talking about [Music] good get that clutch to the biting point and look on approach any chances good approach really well done now count out loud again [Music] good and get into that corner as soon as two passes okay better yeah so you always want to be prepared in second gear on approach and then have enough time to look and if you haven't got a gap you can always stop but you don't want to go and go yeah actually i'm going to just stop there now we have a 40 slip road so get to 40. we're not going to do what that white car just did you want to lean forward towards the steering wheel like we did earlier signal how's it looking yeah so the top mirror is not really that useful at this point because,962.959,1034.72,922,195,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=962,"I would rate this driving situation as a 7 - the student is approaching a busy roundabout and needs to correctly position the car, adjust speed and gears, and make a safe exit towards central London, which requires a high level of attention and skill."
we're coming in at an angle okay all right now this is the roundabout you did earlier when i had to grab the wheel yeah so it's the middle lane and then from the middle what do we have to do go back to the left all right now breaking and what gear should we use good reach the biting point brilliant better i was hoping i wouldn't have to grab a wheel in this one it's okay but it's an honest mistake what happened there so you can't see the lane divide just yet what you're going to see next is the white line next to you it's going to start to move right and you're going to keep with it so when there's traffic leading up to the roundabout the examiner would usually tell you i'd advise you to use the middle lane so from here on you can see the white line moves simply just stay with it now yes we're in the middle lane but the left is going left only yeah do you know what you're doing now once you get,1036.4,1119.679,907,201,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=1036,"a sense of the situation, please do provide me with more information to answer your question accurately."
in wait where am i going i'm going ahead okay yeah so yeah yeah change gear so you're going to go in but check the left mirror and go round to the first exit island and then go through earlier i grabbed the wheel because you were going to enter the second lane at the island which is their lane okay yeah okay,1120.84,1140.16,309,65,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=1120,"Critical level: 7 - The situation is becoming critical as the learner driver is not aware of the correct lane to take at the roundabout, which increases the risk of collision with other vehicles. The coach had to intervene to prevent a potentially dangerous situation."
move it just leave it just leave it focus once you put that signal on just leave it running because as soon as you're out and the wheel is straight it should turn off right yeah okay you don't want to be fiddling with that now you're too slow and everyone's overtaking you okay so any concerns with the roundabout so far i think the key for you was looking at the speed yeah and the monitoring gear getting your foot to the biting point rather than sometimes you think oh yeah it's slowly slowly here here there it is but until you don't reach the buying point it doesn't engage yeah oh we could try um hogarth round about the flyover today oh god,1167.12,1220.4,647,138,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=1167,"3 - The situation is not critical, but the instructor is emphasizing the importance of not fiddling with the signal once it's on to avoid being too slow and holding up other drivers. The mention of a new roundabout might require more attention from the student."
very nice thank you see the approach is feeling so much better already it doesn't feel like we're rushing to that point yeah good so on this one the left doesn't divide the right divides [Music] okay [Music] we're just following signs of central london for a little while okay so we're not turning,1236.559,1271.28,297,63,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=1236,Criticality level: 2 - The driving situation is not critical at all as the instructor and learner are following signs and not turning.
[Music] it was really nice now [Music] yeah when you're on the dual carriageway the roundabouts are usually easier because a lot of the traffic's just going straight from either side so your gaps quite easy whereas the side roads they have to wait a lot longer,1319.37,1349.679,260,57,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=1319,"Critical level: 4 - The situation is not too critical as the traffic on the roundabouts is usually going straight, making it easier to find a gap, but the situation still requires attention and proper driving techniques."
[Music] so you don't need a signal to come off on these roundabouts but when you pass the first exit you can put it on because the lane naturally leaves it's not necessary,1369.05,1385.52,171,38,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=1369,"2 - While it's good to know when to use signals, this situation is not very critical as it's not required to indicate on the first exit of the roundabout."

make sure you're looking at that crossing as well because it is clear again looking around you should have been signaling go into that corner go around a bit more you should have slowed down and stopped there it was fine though to enter but you don't want to follow him too closely okay yeah this crossing's in a really bad spot here,1426.08,1446.96,333,66,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=1426,Criticality: 6 - The situation becomes critical as the crossing is in a bad spot and proper attention and ways to handle it are being discussed.
see the sign yeah what does that tell you that the lane is the left lane is gonna close yeah so we'll just have to see if it is our lane so it's the far left now so we don't need to worry driving down this narrow lane the road ahead curves towards the left eloise turns a little bit suddenly for the curve of the road resulting in the car getting too close to the pavement that was the only time besides the very beginning of today's lesson where i felt the need to grab the wheel all right so what's the plan for the width restriction um you got there okay so we're gonna slow down right yeah okay we're not gonna do it in third gear are we no okay second is okay but if you want to go even slower you can switch down to first but make sure you slow down before it's restriction don't do it as you're there so check right and signal right get into position slow down as early as you want okay,1464.32,1549.44,893,193,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=1464,"6 - The situation is critical as the road curves towards the left and the car gets too close to the pavement. The instructor had to grab the wheel, but it was an isolated incident. The width restriction is also critical, but there is a plan in place to slow down and switch to the appropriate gear."
don't wait for me to tell you to slow down unless it's too late where should your right foot be yeah definitely press it through this bit hold it nice and steady it's good yeah nice okay the gear change was really good but does the vehicle behind slowing down yeah good,1551.279,1571.279,269,55,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=1551,"3 - The driving situation is mildly critical as the instructor is reminding the learner to slow down and pay attention to the vehicle behind, but there is no immediate danger or urgency."

[Music] so they'll both wait for you there good we're looking for a place to park now again no rush [Music] third gear in the meantime you see where the man took the dog in the distance around there there's usually a few parking spaces so [Music] good start breaking here yep there is a signal break a lot more more bit more take some of that pressure off move right a bit tiny that's it just so that we're not really close here on the car yeah switch off the signal and the engine brilliant the hand brake then neutral in that order okay okay okay very good parking by the way yeah but gradually coming because we were quite fast maybe unless the only reason i should do away okay so how was the drive for you yeah it's all right i think towards the end it definitely starts to get a lot better with the roundabouts and gear changes for sure yeah definitely so i want to just address two two or three of the,1615.58,1689.52,908,192,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=1615,Driving situation: 2 - Not critical at all. The situation is simply parking the car and there is no rush or traffic congestion in the area.
main topics like the main key points that i want to go over so firstly that roundabout with the traffic lights they were green yeah and then the car coming around you sort of watching them yeah we did that earlier so i'm surprised that happened actually okay but the position on that roundabout was really nice otherwise and then the one where i had to grab the wheel but you understand now what you did wrong yeah yeah so your position your lane was the middle lane but the left was going left only so your lane is still the left lane in the roundabout whereas you were going for the yeah the other one which again can be easily done but it's their lane okay um then we had the one where you were taking the fourth exit and you started trying to switch down to the left oh yeah i like second yeah i think definitely counting out loud helps yeah definitely yeah keep it up it doesn't matter it doesn't matter if the examiner thinks you're crazy so whatever helps you out just do that okay,1691.36,1749.2,988,198,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=1691,"7 - The driving situation is critical because the learner driver is making positioning errors on roundabouts, which can be dangerous for both themselves and other road users. Additionally, they are struggling with gear changes while executing complex maneuvers, which adds to the risk."
all right so that's the end of today's drive i hope you guys enjoyed today's video and learned a few tips on how to deal with big roundabouts positioning and a bit of an um engine break as well thank you,1750.559,1760.32,203,45,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=1750,0 - The driving situation is not critical at all as the video is simply concluding with some tips and thanking the viewers.

test when looking for a place to pull over and park somewhere safe always try and avoid driveways there are various dipped curbs and malik should have tried to stop by the tree or just after as that's a raised kerb at that point he stops in front of a driveway getting a minor fault okay thank you whenever you're ready let's drive off from here into my blind spot indicate i'm going to check bombers again [Music] when looking around before moving off malik does look all around but then decides to change gear and then doesn't look across to the right to move off again he should check his top mirror right mirror and his right blind spot as a safety check before moving away so looking across to the right should be the last check he does take the second right [Music] turn left then take the second right,97.759,176.8,808,166,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=97,"I would rate the driving situation at a 6. While it's not a life-threatening situation, not properly checking blind spots before moving off can lead to potential accidents."
previously malik really struggled trying to cope with the number of hazards on the road and being able to identify and actually deal with things in good time what really helped him is to identify potential hazards and talk out loud about what he's going to do next this was the best way to keep himself alert so that he wouldn't miss any potential hazards before they start to develop [Music],194.56,219.05,392,77,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=194,"4 - While the situation is not too critical, it is important for Malik to identify and deal with potential hazards on the road to keep himself alert and safe."
previously malik had a habit of keeping his left foot over the clutch even when he wasn't using it because of this his car would coast quite a bit as he would put the clutch down first before braking it's best to pivot your foot towards the left to put it onto the footrest on the side of the clutch malik keeps his foot on the carpet which is also okay [Music] there's a person ahead that's quite bored [Music],246.08,273.73,411,92,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=246,"Critical level: 6. 

While there is a person ahead who might be a potential hazard, the situation is not too critical as there is no immediate danger and the instruction being given is more focused on correcting the driver's bad habit."
when following instructions from the sat nav you want to listen and also watch the screen in front to see how far the next junction is the sat nav will give the instructions one after the other if the two turns are really close together at the end of the road turn right then cross the roundabout and take the second exit [Music] turn right then cross the roundabout and take the second exit [Music],290.24,329.89,399,81,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=290,"6 - Although the situation isn't extremely critical, it still requires attention and focus as the driver needs to process the instructions and make quick decisions at the roundabout."
cross the roundabout and take the second exit,346.8,349.199,45,9,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=346,3 - The driving situation is slightly critical because the driver needs to be aware of the traffic flow around the roundabout and correctly navigate to the second exit.
cross the roundabout and take the second exit [Music],365.199,368.74,53,12,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=365,"2 - While there may be some traffic and decision-making involved in crossing a roundabout and taking the correct exit, this situation is relatively routine and not highly critical."
malik deals with the oncoming learner vehicle really well and moves to the left in good time to avoid slowing down and stopping after 200 yards cross the roundabout and take the second exit then turn left after this large van malik moves back towards the left hand side of the road and leans forward to look behind the parked vehicles to make sure the roundabout is clear cross the roundabout and take the second exit then turn left [Music] it says the number of yards until the next turn when the junction is less than 100 yards is usually when you should be using emirates looking for the junction and signaling accordingly after 200 yards turn left [Music] turn left as a new road has parked vehicles on the right hand side of the road malik decided to wait at the t-junction for a little bit longer as the vehicles approaching from the left were in the middle of the road after 150 yards turn left a40.,385.52,500.879,906,188,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=385,"6 - The driving situation is moderately critical as there are multiple turns and roundabouts to navigate, but Malik handles them well and takes necessary precautions such as checking for oncoming vehicles and waiting for clear paths."
at the end of the road turn left turn left,508.16,518.0,42,10,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=508,"Critical level: 3 - The situation is not too critical as the instruction is simple and there is time to execute it safely, but there could be potential hazards such as oncoming traffic or pedestrians crossing."
after one mile keep right when joining from a slip road always focus on getting up to the speed of the road and use the lower gears to get up to that speed quicker the speed on this road is 40 miles per hour malik is driving between 30 to about 35 miles per hour this is not an issue as the traffic doesn't allow for him to drive up to that speed without getting too close to the van in front,534.72,564.399,392,87,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=534,"Critical level: 4 - While the driver is not driving at the recommended speed, it is not a critical situation as it is due to traffic conditions."
it's after 800 yards keep right to change into the middle lane malik uses his mirrors and signals he leans forward into the right hand mirror to make sure that nobody from the third lane is moving into the middle lane at the same time as him if he looks in his mirror normally without leaning forward there is a big section of the third lane which is missing which goes into his blind spot so when you lean forward it opens up your blind spot so that you can see more of that lane,588.72,628.88,480,98,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=588,"Critical level: 7 - There is potential danger from other vehicles changing lanes, and the driver must take extra precautions to ensure safety."
after 800 yards take the exit b455 yeti take the exit then go left on the brunder boat and take the first exit when taking an exit at a slip road from a dual carriageway start moving towards the left as soon as the white line starts to come in once on the exit malik should have stayed towards the left as he knows he's taking the first exit he checked his mirrors and moves over so this wouldn't be an issue the first exit day 418 would be 555 towards the heading go left on the roundabout and take the first exit on approach to this left turn at the roundabout malik should have been signaling left on approach he does signal but he signals quite late as this didn't affect anyone around him this wouldn't be a fault this is and it's safe to do so i'd like to demonstrate he would wash the front windscreen thank you,655.519,751.04,818,180,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=655,"2 - The driving situation is not very critical as it involves taking an exit and making a left turn on a roundabout, but attention to detail is needed to avoid any issues."
on approach to the traffic ahead malik slows down really well and changes gears down on approach to the traffic and avoids having to stop [Music] on approach of temporary traffic lights or traffic lights that have been green for a long time always step off the accelerator on approach in case the lights change as you want to be able to stop,783.92,812.32,341,66,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=783,Criticality: 7 - It is important to be aware of temporary traffic lights or traffic lights that have been green for a long time and to step off the accelerator in case the lights change as stopping abruptly can be dangerous.
after 300 yards cross the roundabout and take the third exit a312,834.8,838.24,65,15,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=834,Critical level: 3. This is a relatively simple instruction and the road seems to be clear.
on approach to this roundabout to take the third exit you have to start off in the right hand lane as we go forward from this position the right hand lane divides into two and both the middle and the right lane both go third exit roundabout and take the third exit a312 as we're waiting at the traffic lights to enter the roundabout an emergency vehicle is approaching from the right malik notices the emergency vehicle approaching and deals with them really safely once the emergency vehicle passes malik starts to enter the roundabout he's already past the stop line and the traffic light starts changing it's safe to continue at this point as he enters the roundabout he goes into the wrong lane he goes round and realizes this and he starts using his mirrors and signals and changes lane in good time so this wouldn't be an issue take the exit a312 [Music] once on the exit he realizes he's in the overtaking lane so he makes good,855.04,926.72,934,188,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=855,"judgment and moves into the left lane, making the situation a 5 - moderately critical, as the emergency vehicle added extra pressure to the situation and the mistake of entering the wrong lane could have led to potential danger."
progress and starts using his mirrors to come back into the left hand lane safely as the roundabout was clear when he tried to switch lanes it was safe to do so had anybody been next to him when he was trying to switch lanes it would be safer to just follow that lane and take the next exit instead,928.639,944.32,298,61,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=928,"Criticality: 3 - The situation is relatively safe as there are no immediate dangers, but a potential danger could arise if there were other vehicles in the adjacent lane."
after 300 yards go left on the roundabout and take the first exit on approach to this roundabout to take the first exit malik does make a serious fault on junction observation malik takes the gap as the vehicle next to him takes the gap to enter the roundabout the gap was safe for the vehicle next to him as they were just crossing the van's path but it was not safe for malik to enter as the van was going the same way and leaving the roundabout on the first exit sharp left [Music] the vehicle next to us in the roundabout was able to take that gap a lot faster and also they were only crossing the van's path so it was safe for them to enter but not for us as we were moving in front of the van it wasn't safe to enter as we're moving in from complete stationery and the van's already approaching between 15 to 20 miles per hour and as it comes round the van driver did speed up [Music] um,974.639,1060.24,893,200,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=974,"Critical level: 9 - Malik made a serious fault on junction observation and attempted to enter a roundabout when it was not safe to do so, potentially risking a collision with a vehicle already on the roundabout."
[Music] after 200 yards go left on the roundabout and take the first exit [Music] go left on the roundabout and take the first exit [Music] on this new road malik's driving initially a little slow as he's just turned in from the roundabout the vehicle behind starts overtaking you need to keep regular checks on your mirrors so that you know what the vehicle behind is doing at all times just because the vehicle behind has overtaken this would not go down as a fault for driving too slowly malik's always been driving at the correct speed according to the traffic and the road conditions but as soon as you hear that there's a motorbike or a motor vehicle quite close you should check regular mirrors to see where they are [Music] is at the end of the road to turn right there were two lanes both lanes turn right malik should have gone in the first of the two lanes as that's the position for normal driving,1069.13,1172.96,909,192,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=1069,"Criticality level: 3

Explanation: While it is important to keep regular checks on mirrors, the situation is not particularly critical as the driving is taking place on a new road and the vehicle behind is only overtaking."
as we turn into the new road both lanes do merge so this wouldn't necessarily be a fault as they merged straight away,1175.2,1179.36,117,24,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=1175,3 - It's not a very critical situation since the merging lanes are straight away and it wouldn't result in any fault.
turn right b455,1195.12,1195.12,15,4,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=1195,5 - The situation is moderately critical as the student is required to turn right onto a specific road and may need to adjust their speed and position accordingly.
street [Music] um as we're waiting in the line of traffic the left signal is very confusing as we're in the right hand lane with the left signal and we're not moving over the position normal driving wouldn't be a minor fault as the lanes merged straight away [Music] after go right on 200 roundabout and take the third exit [Music] go right on the roundabout and take the third exit [Music] uh [Music],1210.64,1298.05,401,91,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=1210,Criticality: 5 - The confusing signal can cause some inconvenience but it doesn't pose any immediate danger to the driver or other road users.

two after 200 yards turn left then turn right,1358.84,1364.4,45,10,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=1358,Critical Level: 2 - This instruction is not very critical as it is just a simple direction to turn left then turn right after a certain distance.
deals with this narrow entrance really well by selecting first gear and slowly entering into the road when there's enough space,1385.12,1390.72,127,23,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=1385,Critical level: 3 - The driving situation is relatively low in criticality as the driver is proceeding slowly and cautiously through a narrow entrance.
turn right um ignore that actually just continue ahead from here if you can pull it up on the left just after the street lamps [Music] thank you i'm just going to turn off the satna from here okay that's the end of your independent driving i'm going to give you directions as normal from now on so move off whenever you're ready and at the end of the road we're going to turn right,1414.64,1442.24,381,83,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=1414,3 - The driving situation is not very critical as the instructor is giving directions and the road seems fairly clear.
to turn right [Music] don't worry about the drives on this occasion just in that space thank you okay so what we're going to do now is i would like you to carry out the parallel park exercise using the vehicle in front of us so pull up alongside the vehicle in the road then reverse back and finish within two car spaces try not to touch the pavement as you do this exercise,1461.44,1504.96,374,78,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=1461,"Critical level: 8 - The situation is quite critical as the student is about to carry out a parallel park exercise, which can be difficult and requires careful handling of the vehicle to avoid causing damage or potentially causing an accident."
all okay um,1527.36,1541.12,11,3,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=1527,1 - The situation is not critical as everything appears to be alright.
right at the beginning of the reversing exercise malik did look all around making sure that he looked over both shoulders whilst reversing he's not looking over his right blind spot now this can be a serious fault if somebody turns up whilst he's reversing the back tire only touches as malik was steering very slowly as the back gets close to the pavement,1561.12,1590.0,356,68,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=1561,Criticality: 8 - Not checking the right blind spot while reversing can be a serious fault and cause accidents if someone appears suddenly.
thank you and drive off whenever you're ready,1628.32,1630.96,45,9,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=1628,Critical level: 5 - The situation is moderately critical as the driver is being given permission to drive off but there is no further information provided about the road or traffic conditions.
um [Music] take the next road on your left,1657.44,1671.44,42,11,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=1657,"3 - This situation is somewhat critical as the driver needs to make sure they are approaching the left turn at the appropriate speed and are aware of any potential hazards on the road. However, there does not appear to be any immediate danger or urgency in this maneuver."
we should be able to just next to that gray car by that tree not on the road not on the pavement sorry just on the road brilliant okay all right all right so how would you say you did today malik i thought i did all right okay it was a really good drive but unfortunately you wouldn't have passed on this occasion okay now i feel really bad saying this but it's only one serious fault was it the roundabout yeah what did you think you did on that roundabout i think it went a little bit too early yeah so that gap that you took you couldn't quite see next to that car so as you've gone in that van's coming round and that van i know he was on the inside lane of that roundabout but what's to say he's not just going to leave straight away which is exactly what he did so we're now in his path and i know he wasn't very aggressive or tailing you or anything but we shouldn't be taking gaps,1694.0,1764.799,888,196,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=1694,"Situation: 8 - The situation was critical as the driver took a gap on a roundabout that was not safe, leading to a potential collision with a van."
like that especially when you can't see with the big car that was next to you so that was it it felt really bad for me to sort of go shoot he's done it no no no don't do it you know but that was the only serious fault besides that i felt like the drive was really good there was so much good going on there like in terms of your approach to things you were checking your mirror signaling at the right point slowing down in good time all your turns were really nice into even the smaller roads okay that parallel park how was that it wasn't very good okay now you've done it much better than that previously so you could see your reference had reached but you're sort of just going okay yeah turn rather than all right turn yeah yeah i was taking i was being a bit slow i felt like the minute it touched the line i was like let me just spin and then i was like hold on i'm taking this really slowly and then yeah i should have been,1766.72,1812.799,930,197,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=1766,"Critical level: 3 - The driving situation was not very critical as the only serious fault was the one mentioned and the rest of the drive was good, with proper approach, signaling, and turning. The parallel parking was not great, but there was no imminent danger."
a bit quicker so it's okay that's all right so as soon as you felt that back tire touching just go into first you can't go back anymore you have to go forward now when you go forward you don't have to start the whole thing again you can just fix it yeah which is probably easier isn't it yeah um right i'm going to go through some of the minor faults that went on so right at the very beginning when i asked you to park up you parked up in front of a driveway and there was a very clear section where there was no driveway and then there was one driveway so you went right in front of that drive and stopped so whenever it's stopping trying not to block driveway so the high curb is what you want to stop next to okay um the slip road you nearly missed your indicator you put it on yeah yeah yeah i i should have done it a little bit earlier i saw the 40 miles an hour but i was concentrating on the 20,1815.12,1861.76,902,196,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=1815,"Critical level: 2 - The situation is mostly focused on minor faults and mistakes, and doesn't pose immediate danger to the driver or others."
then i was like i should have put it quicker yeah but it's okay you did have it on which is nice your lane changes on the carriageway were very nice you're keeping up to the right speed good distance from the vehicles in front also one of the roundabouts i felt like um i changed lanes because i was on the wrong lane yes yes was that okay you did that really well so when you went into that roundabout you started in the overtaking lane which is fine it went there but as soon as you've gone into that roundabout you've gone into the furthest right which actually on the floor says you knew you weren't going to yetings you should have been in the one across yeah now as you went round you've checked and you know you've still carried on in the same lane when you could have just switched over and then when the exit was coming up you checked signaled you checked again safely moved over which is great but now let's say on that particular,1863.2,1906.64,940,199,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=1863,driving situation is at a 3 as the lane change mistake was minor and was corrected safely.
roundabout you had some cars coming up behind i would probably have to go around if that was the case i'm glad you didn't take us off track there because there was so much traffic going the other way okay but yeah you should have been looking at that floor marking slightly earlier on yeah but because you dealt with it really nicely it was great um the position normal driving so sometimes when there's two lanes and they're both going the same way you keep getting into the overtaking one and there are two lanes on a neighborhood whether it's an a road whether it's uh not you don't really do it in the a-road but just generally if there are two lanes turning at a traffic light and they're both going the same way yeah yeah you keep going for the right right just because you're making a right turn yeah yeah which was okay because you did stay in that lane and then move back safely with your mirror check so there's,1908.08,1953.2,921,188,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=1908,"Critical level: 4 - While there were some potential hazards with cars behind and multiple lanes, the situation was handled well by the driver and instructor."
no serious faults with it but it's just you know if you can see you're going right and that one also goes go for that one yeah there was a bit of confusion with your signal back there near when with a sort of a black hole was behind that little micra yeah i don't know why but again you got into the right hand lane because we're turning right in 300 which is quite a bit of distance there and um there's a queue of traffic on the right and on the left there's like one or two cars but you went into the right lane and when you're there you were indicating but you're still in the right lane so it's a bit confusing for the driver behind yeah but they couldn't get through regardless so that's why it wasn't really a big fault or anything you didn't hold anybody up because he couldn't get through anyways okay um but yeah much better than before not a lot going on but did you think that was a serious,1954.559,2001.279,902,196,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=1954,"Situation: 3 - There was some confusion with the signal and lane change, but there was no immediate danger to other drivers on the road."
fault when you moved in front of that van i did but also because i was just jumping left i thought that i could take my opportunity but next time upon reflection it is better to wait because obviously you need to be a safer driver rather than uh you know try a speedy driver so i think coupon reflection is something that i'll take back and reflect on but it's if you know that it's a serious fault obviously but do you understand why that's a serious fault yeah because he he was he was going in and he could have just turned left and essentially we could have questions he was behind us afterwards it wasn't like he took that overtaking laying on the exit he went for the left lane yeah now we went left straight after so we took that sharp left and he went past us behind yeah so he did want the left-hand lane and we were there so let's say he's coming around and he's going into that round about he's speeding up yeah on that point and,2002.559,2050.48,940,196,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=2002,"Critical level: 7

you're right in front of him he's gonna honk you there or just you know be okay so that's the end of today's drive i hope you guys enjoyed that mock test and you can see he's made a lot more progress and there's only one fault but we're gonna we're gonna get that down by the monday yes you,2052.72,2075.679,290,69,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=2052,"Critical level: 0.

hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving today it's malik's test so today we're just doing a quick sort of 15 20 minute if that drive and then we're going to go to the test center so i'm just going over anything it's a nice little drive for now nothing in particular all right so whenever you're ready we'll get driving we'll just come out the car park right and then just right out of the entrance just there how are you feeling today malik oh good we're gonna go right at those lights okay all right we'll sort them out in just a second should be on in the new road what lane do we take take the left lane all right we're going to go left to that round about first [Music] all right let's get these mirrors sorted out how's that perfect do you want 50 50 with the horizon okay you don't want it too low as you would normally can you,20.88,110.32,839,191,QeTzM47ikO4,1139,https://youtu.be/QeTzM47ikO4?t=20,Critical level: 1 - The driving situation is not critical at all.

see your car in that one a little bit uh yeah yeah and same with that one yeah okay and the top is okay as well yeah we're taking first left that's third game well done [Music] you can hear it right yeah so as long as you don't stall without there it's not really a fault as long as you correct it quickly okay,112.72,139.36,310,71,QeTzM47ikO4,1139,https://youtu.be/QeTzM47ikO4?t=112,3.

good the speed on slip road great it's just the handling of the steering wheel near the end yeah just because of the high speed it's more sensitive isn't it yeah so smaller movements okay on the next roundabout let's take the third exit right please,166.319,178.72,249,51,QeTzM47ikO4,1139,https://youtu.be/QeTzM47ikO4?t=166,Critical level: 2.

okay you dealt with that nicely but you knew you were turning left after that prius was sticking out you'd already checked your mirror you should have positioned into that left section as opposed to turning from the middle can i really carefully here you've got lots of vans keep scanning either side the gear is not a problem honestly it's going to be too jolty see that yeah because your speed was still 10 10 12. just stay in the second gear but keep looking side to side break if you need to slow down it's like now with all these large vehicles just scanning ahead of them looking for anyone that might be in the road now turn left here now wait wait we look both ways so make sure you're not rolling forward as you're looking one way because he could have been on the other side of the road as well keep scanning so on the left and the distance is nothing how's the right clear afterwards okay what's he doing,1123.36,1185.6,915,190,N0VBjNTMQgA,1999,https://youtu.be/N0VBjNTMQgA?t=1123,"Critical situation: 6 - While there are multiple large vehicles present, the situation is not overly dangerous, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and take appropriate actions."
what do you think the spin lori is doing stopping in the middle yes slowly start to move forward then and as you're moving start turning keep looking behind him turn turn but look behind him also because cyclists can still get through yeah we need to be more cautious with that been laurie there going ahead from here [Music] turn right in here [Music] what was he doing he was just parked on the on the junction in that space weirdly hey what's going on here see that roundabout can we go over it or can we go around it break clutch first gear have a look across we're gonna go around it completely because it's more than enough space i remember going over that round about last lesson good now we're going to pull over and park up on the left just on that single yellow line so just check yeah move into that space just there go break a lot more don't come in so sharply come in gradually because you've got lots of room breaking a bit more,1187.2,1261.28,942,198,N0VBjNTMQgA,1999,https://youtu.be/N0VBjNTMQgA?t=1187,"Critical level: 3.

okay i know we're blocking drives we're not going to be here for very long just secure the car for a minute good so how's the drive going so far good just loads of hazards loads yeah so on that high street what happened with that black range rover that was coming in um i shouldn't have gone forward because i wouldn't have been enough space yeah so then we're blocking your cycle box no not that bit i'm talking about the black range rover we're just ahead of that junction she was moving over when she was opening the door yeah so first she opened the door and she got into the car and moved in front of you right yeah if i wanted to swerve i should have done check your mirrors for them [Music] yeah so if you're already driving in your lane and she's trying to push in you've got two options you're either going to slow down for her and stay in your lane or if it's safe you're going to check the right side mirrors signal,1263.52,1310.48,926,199,N0VBjNTMQgA,1999,https://youtu.be/N0VBjNTMQgA?t=1263,"Critical level: 7.

and move over to give her that space to come out so that you're moving at the same time but if you feel like it's too overwhelming to do all of that which it kind of was you're safer just to slow down for her instead okay so i had to help you at that point so just be wary of houses like that from now on and the other thing i want to talk about is that been laurie just now so at first he's on the left and you were rolling forward so make sure you stop behind the line completely and look both ways before even that little bit of roll forward that we had and then once he's on the right and he's waiting there look both ways start turning but keep looking both ways why do we have to still look both ways for cyclists because they could still fit in between us that's it so they could still be on the other side of that lorry they could there could be a motorbike but you've got those um,1312.4,1354.64,889,196,N0VBjNTMQgA,1999,https://youtu.be/N0VBjNTMQgA?t=1312,"Criticality: 5 - The situation is moderately critical.

with forward or reverse bay parking always make sure you put the driver's seat of the vehicles next to you alongside you if you need to you can always readjust the examiners would usually ask you if you're happy to leave the vehicle there they would only check to make sure the tires are in the space if they're unsure or they suspect the car is over the white line turn left always keep to a slow speed when you're in a car park as there may be pedestrians or small children that could easily be hidden always watch out for vehicles that may move off or open the door as you're driving past at the end term right [Music] the view of the new road is restricted by park vehicles mia leans forward making sure that there's nobody approaching behind the parked cars using slow clutch control to move forward roundabout turn left [Music],1238.64,1320.47,833,168,dny73JdIb-M,2319,https://youtu.be/dny73JdIb-M?t=1238,"Criticality: 2 - The situation is not very critical as the driving is taking place in a car park, where pedestrians and other vehicles may be present, but the speed is slow and caution is being exercised."

[Music] do hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving my name is amin and today i'm doing a mock test for ram now ram has contacted me online and wanted to do a mock test because he's got his test coming up in about three weeks time is it um he's done around 35 hours of driving previously over the last two three months or so with another instructor he just wanted to get another opinion before his test and that's what we're doing today so we're in ashford and i'm just gonna go through a mixture of roads with you just do a mock test and see how you do so um throughout the drive follow the road ahead whenever i need you to turn i'm gonna tell you in plenty of time if i don't say anything keep going straight um if you're not sure where you're going you can ask but simply going straight will be the answer for that one and we're going to do one maneuver we may,0.08,63.039,869,192,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=0,"Rate: 3 - The driving situation is not critical at all. The instructor is simply conducting a mock test for a student who has driven over 35 hours previously, and the driving will consist of mainly following the road and performing one maneuver."
also carry out the emergency stop so similar to everything you've already been practicing with your instructor okay i'm going to get you to carry out 20 minutes of independent driving which is where i'm going to give you a series of directions to follow okay um before we get started we're going to do a quick question so could you tell me where would you find the information for the recommended tire pressure and how do you check this information um so the recommended type pressure would be on the um once you open the door behind the seat there will be a sticker okay for the marking there or if it's not there it's there in the instructor manuals okay then you use a reliable uh pressure gauge to check the tire pressure perfect thank you okay so when you're ready let's get started so just start the engine and then we'll get driving so just to go through this is a completely new car for ram today he's been driving a different car we've had about 10 minutes of driving so far um,64.799,120.079,986,199,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=64,Critical level 1 - This situation is not critical at all as the instructor is just explaining the next steps of the lesson and asking a question about tire pressure.
and we've gone over a few points but it was a good drive so far okay all right so whenever you're ready let's um go up to the end of this road and make a right turn okay,122.32,130.239,169,41,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=122,"Critical level: 2 - The driving situation is not critical at all, as the learner driver has been driving well so far and the instruction is only to make a right turn at the end of the road."
while changing gears between one and two ram always goes back into neutral and then goes back to the left and back into second gear now this wouldn't be an issue as long as you always end up in the correct gear [Music] at the roundabout turn right [Music],169.92,197.73,255,55,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=169,"Critical level: 5 - Not an immediate dangerous situation but the problem could lead to confusion and errors in the future, especially during quick gear changes."
on the right turn at the mini roundabout ram should have tried to go more around the mini roundabout to make the right turn as there was enough space you can sort of go over the roundabout with your tyres from the right hand side but you should try to keep the tires from the left hand side off the roundabout [Music],226.4,244.65,317,68,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=226,Critical level: 2 - The situation is not very critical as it is just a minor adjustment needed for the turn.
so ron deals really well with hazards always trying to allow two car lengths of clearance from anyone that may be reversing or turning it's always a good idea to leave more clearance when someone is reversing as they may not be aware of your presence and they may need more space so you don't want to put any pressure on them [Music] there are two roundabouts they're very close together we're taking that road ahead but it's the right and then a left at the second one so right at the first round [Music],275.199,334.32,505,106,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=275,"Critical level: 3. 

The situation involves navigating two roundabouts close together, but the instructor does not mention any specific hazards or dangers, indicating that the situation is manageable with caution."
so [Music] at the end of this road turn left and then left again the two turns are quite close together [Music] so just in here one approach to this left turn rom slows down really well as it is a really narrow sharp entrance into the left turn [Music] oops [Music] on approach to any meeting encounters ram slows down really well leaving enough clearance from the oncoming vehicle as well as any parked vehicles,372.88,443.039,412,86,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=372,"Critical level: 7 

The situation is quite critical as the two left turns are close together, and the entrance to the left turn is narrow and sharp with multiple potential hazards, such as oncoming and parked vehicles that require enough clearance."
[Music] if you can pull over and pop up on the left don't worry about the driveways on this occasion just on the road anywhere along here thank you drive off whenever you're ready in preparation to move off always get the gear ready then look around and then move off and take the road on the right please [Music] with narrow entrances especially when you can't see into the road always prepare in first gear before making the turn before turning left or turning right ram always checks all three mirrors before turning you only really need to check the top mirror and the exterior mirror in the direction that you're going but there's no harm in checking all of the mirrors turn left [Music] on approach to closed crossroads ram approaches really slowly looking carefully in every direction to make sure it's safe before he emerges [Music] if you can pull over and pile up on the left on approach to this stop ram gets a minor fault for position normal stops as,459.3,570.08,962,191,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=459,"Critical level: 6. 

The driving situation is not extremely critical but requires caution as the instructor is giving instructions for specific actions and situations such as preparing for turns, checking mirrors, and approaching crossroads and stop signs. Students should pay attention and follow the instructions carefully."
he parks in front of a driveway there was a space before the driveway and after the driveway to park somewhere safe without blocking anyone's way okay that's fine okay so we're gonna start the independent driving from here so i'm gonna give you a series of directions to follow so let's go up to the end of this road turn right yeah okay sorry you can come crazy okay so at the end of this road turn left okay okay and then take the next road on the right left and right okay so left and right yeah so drive off when you're ready oh [Music] it's okay these bumps you can't really avoid sometimes i'm just feeling if i'm hitting the curb they do their job they don't they with this junction ram gets a minor fault for junction observation there was a bit of a dip at the end of the road and his attention went on to the gear suspecting that there was an issue there and he was looking over towards the right hand side of the road but not as,572.16,660.56,939,200,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=572,"Critical rating: 4 - The situation is not extremely critical, but the driver did receive a minor fault for not observing the junction properly, which could potentially be a safety concern if repeated in more complex intersections."
much towards the left and there was a large vehicle on the left-hand side which can easily hide vehicles oncoming,662.32,666.079,113,22,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=662,Criticality level: 8 - The situation is quite critical as the presence of a large vehicle obstructing the view can make it difficult to spot oncoming vehicles coming from the left.
is from here [Music],684.959,689.72,20,6,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=684,"0. Not critical at all. This is just background music, it has no impact on the driving situation."
on approach to compulsory turns similar to this left turn onto the dual carriageway you will not be told which way to go as the road only goes one way but you do need to signal for this left turn the signal will help pedestrians in any other hazards as drivers know that you can only go that way while waiting at this position to make a left turn rum carries on looking towards the right hand side the whole time you should still look both ways as pedestrians may start to cross the road in front of you or there may be a hazard on the left hand side of the road as we turned onto the dual carriageway there was a vehicle ahead that had just reversed from a driveway ram notices this and starts moving into the overtaking lane to overtake as they are moving slower but as the vehicle manages to pick up speed quickly he moves back into the normal driving lane,729.6,788.32,859,175,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=729,Critical level: 6. The situation is not extremely critical but still requires attention and caution as there may be pedestrians or hazards on the left-hand side and overtaking requires being aware of other vehicles' movements.
okay we're gonna be following the signs to kingston now for a little while yes please,807.6,811.68,85,18,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=807,"Critical level: 2. This is a routine instruction for following signs, and there are no specific hazards or challenges mentioned."
whilst traveling along on a dual carriageway leading up to roadwork signs there'll be various signs to tell you what's going on ahead the first sign is to show you that there's roadworks ahead the second sign tells us that there is a closure on the right hand lane in the dual carriageway ahead of us you can now see the cones laid out blocking off the right hand lane so it would be a good idea to check mirrors towards the right as you go forward in case anyone's overtaking the signs towards kingston leading up to this roundabout is partially covered by another sign if you can't see the direction that you should be going into the examiner would usually tell you which way you should be turning but you can ask if you're unsure,829.6,867.199,732,155,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=829,"Criticality: 7 - The situation is critical as the presence of roadworks and lane closure can cause disruption and potential hazards, making it necessary to be cautious and alert while driving."
this line's been covered,883.92,883.92,24,5,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=883,Cannot provide an answer as the given fragment does not provide sufficient context to determine the criticality of the driving situation.
was there actually a sign there was it covered it was covered actually the back one yeah i thought so was good but i did manage to see yeah no sorry i should have mentioned it,901.36,910.8,175,36,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=901,"2 - Although there was some confusion about a covered sign, it did not put anyone in immediate danger or require any sudden evasive action."
oh my god [Music],926.32,928.37,17,6,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=926,0 - This is not critical at all. The statement is not related to any driving situation or instruction.
so [Music] so [Music],961.519,985.09,21,8,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=961,0 - This fragment does not contain any information related to a critical driving situation.

at the roundabout terminal,1090.24,1090.24,26,5,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=1090,Critical level: 6 - The driving situation is relatively critical because roundabouts can be busy and require attention to traffic flow and signaling.
[Music] on this busy mini roundabout ram enters really well with the vehicle ahead as they're blocking the vehicles on the right hand side from entry [Music] well it's safe to do so i'd like to demonstrate how you would miss the front windscreen [Music] thank you [Music] and the roundabouts are right [Music],1107.8,1164.51,309,70,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=1107,"Critical level: 6 

Although there is no immediate danger present, the situation is still moderately critical due to the busy mini roundabout, obstructed entry from the right-hand side, and the need to demonstrate how to safely navigate the roundabout."
ahead of us there is a priority sign in front where we need to give way to the oncoming traffic there is a bollard present but the priority sign is hidden behind the trees until a little bit later ram gets a minor fault for control on foot brake as his brake was a little bit sharp as he didn't see the priority sign in time this giveaway was just hidden actually but that the road marking was there whenever you move off from this sort of position you should always check mirrors towards the right in case of any motorbikes or cyclists that may have turned up whilst you're waiting [Music] take the next road on your right with this right turn ram approaches really well going over into the middle of the road before the right turn the first half of the road has give way lines so you need to turn after the tree where the blue keep left side is present [Music],1192.0,1252.87,862,177,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=1192,"Critical level: 5 - There is a priority sign that requires giving way to oncoming traffic, and the sign is partially hidden behind trees. Ram's foot brake had a minor fault, making the situation slightly more risky. Checking mirrors before moving off is necessary, and there may be motorbikes or cyclists. The right turn needs to be executed after a particular tree, which has a blue ""keep left"" marker on it, and there are give way lines on the first half of the road."
okay well i'd like you to pull over and park on the right hand side of the road don't worry about the driveways on this occasion [Music] just maybe we're along the right is fine i think that'll be great now okay what i'd like you to do now is we're going to carry out the reverse exercise so i'd like you to reverse bank for about two car lengths keeping reasonably close to and parallel with the pavement as you do this exercise try not to touch the pavement okay okay so whenever you're ready,1291.36,1331.2,494,107,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=1291,"3 - While the exercise is still relatively low-stress, reversing for two car lengths requires a degree of focus and precision."
oh no we're going to carry out the reverse oh well you said it was badly oh okay fine sorry i didn't mean to,1348.88,1356.159,108,26,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=1348,"give a number: 1 - This is not critical at all, as it is simply a minor mistake during a driving lesson."

ram looks all around while reversing but as he's reversing he slightly tilted the wheel which caused the back right tire to eventually touch the pavement as the back tire has only just touched the pavement really lightly this would not be a serious fault but it would be counted as a minor fault as he had to go forward the real issue started when he went forward as he did not look all around and then to reverse the second time round his attention was now on the right hand mirror and making sure the back right tire doesn't touch which now caused him to get a serious for observation as he did not look around whilst reversing for two car lens thank you drive off when you're ready,1396.64,1440.72,684,133,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=1396,"Critical level: 8 - Ram made a minor fault while reversing, but the real issue started when he didn't look around before reversing the second time, causing a serious fault for observation."
when moving off from the right-hand side of the road always look towards the left-hand side at the end to make sure the road is clear before moving off turn right at the end it's where gluten left sorry,1460.64,1473.039,202,42,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=1460,Criticality: 5 - The instruction is important for safety but the mistake at the end is not critical to driving.
[Music] oh and then turn right okay yeah it's fine not meant to be probably gonna be there a while we're just gonna have to not i don't think uh it will be there um maybe we can reverse it it's best to reverse i'm gonna guide you with this okay so if you could just reverse because we're not meant to reverse that around so looking this way just turn towards me fully run turn towards me fully fully towards me look the other way and then just drive forward,1497.23,1552.48,457,99,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=1497,"Critical level: 4 - The situation is not too critical as it involves reversing and maneuvering around an obstacle.

along this road as the park vehicles are all on the right hand side of the road we do have priority so the oncoming vehicles will need to slow down and stop for us you would still need to slow down and adjust your speed as some of the gaps on the right are small [Music],1601.44,1615.48,270,59,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=1601,"Criticality: 4 - It is important to slow down and adjust speed, but the situation is not extremely critical as there is priority and the oncoming vehicles will stop."

This situation is not very critical as the car is simply driving through a roundabout, however it still requires some attention and caution."
oops [Music] just left from here and then straight at the next one [Music] and straight ahead from here towards ashford [Music] ram approaches this roundabout really well in the left-hand lane to follow the road ahead on approach he notices a gap as he's entering so he doesn't need to slow down or stop as soon as he enters the roundabout he goes round towards the left sticking to the outside lane to take the second exit [Music],1722.399,1777.2,431,93,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=1722,"5 - While approaching a roundabout, it is important to be cautious and follow the correct lane, but there is no immediate danger in this situation."
rum approaches this roundabout really well as he goes forward he has to go slightly over the roundabout just using the tyres on the right hand side to do so if needed this is safe [Music] okay we're gonna pull over and park up on this road just behind the red car and we are gonna actually go on the pavement for this bit so if you can just slow it right down and we're gonna go up from the driveway okay so if you want you can go up from this drive just here yeah that's fine from that drive there so to get the tire on from the drive get half on the pavement and then just move away so we're in line with the red car and just stop there while the pedestrians pass that'll be great there thank you this is fine yeah we're okay here and just switch off the engine that'll be the end of your test give me a few minutes how was the drive for you oh it was good but i think there are a,1802.24,1873.919,882,195,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=1802,"5 - The driving situation is not critical as it involves parking and pulling over, but there is a need to be cautious due to pedestrians on the pavement."
few areas which uh i think i might need some improvement on okay now overall it was a really good drive okay i'm not just saying that it was a good drive um but unfortunately i would have said fail and that's it's a shame why you fail because it was the reversing i hit the go by now yeah you hit the kerb at the back on the right tyre that's the first bit but and then when you went forward you kind of didn't really look around fully to go forward since the first bit and then while reversing because you hit the back tire your attention was now solely on the right side not on that blind spot not on this blind spot you would kind of just focus just on reversing and not hitting that tire yeah so that's mainly the reason why it would have been a serious fault besides that i want to just go over a few things um right near the beginning when we started the independent driving when we got to that junction where you thought the gear had a problem,1876.64,1928.48,950,197,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=1876,"Criticality: 8 - The situation is critical as the learner driver committed a serious fault during reversing and did not pay attention to blind spots, which could have led to accidents."
oh yes yeah it wasn't the gear there was a bit of a dip in the road so the tyre didn't move because it wasn't going to go forward because it's uphill it wasn't going to go backwards because it's down into that gradient little slope so we're just sitting in that dip and then you're looking right in your attention on the gear and you're mainly attending like looking on the right i know the left was clear but there was a van blocking your view so what you need to do is when you're at these junctions and it's busy like not even busy sorry when you what you need to do is when you get to these t-junctions is to keep checking both even if it's completely clear on one side keep checking both because i was afraid somebody might turn up on the left there okay okay earlier when i asked you to park up i felt like every time i asked you to park up you're trying to park up,1930.72,1972.88,871,192,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=1930,"Criticality: 6 - The driving situation is not extremely critical, but requires focus and attention as there were obstacles and limited visibility at a T-junction. The instructor emphasizes the importance of continuously checking both sides for potential hazards."
immediately okay is that what you do you kind of look for the first place and you kind of i just looked into the uh mirror and there wasn't any vehicle and then there was space space no i feel like sometimes there might be a few spaces to park you kind of try and park closer immediately the first little bit rather than letting the car go okay well i'll park up there and you know go a bit further and because of this when i asked you to park up there was like a little small section where there was no driveway and then there was a driveway and then there was a big section where there was no driveway now because you've parked up quite quickly you're now in the driveway okay so that's why i've given you position normal stops okay um when you didn't see that giveaway road marking yeah i've only put down your control on foot brake because we we stopped a bit sharp there because you hadn't seen the uh the marking there um junction observation i've just put,1974.84,2026.799,962,198,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=1974,"Criticality Score: 4 - The situation is not very critical as the learner driver is in a parked position, however, their lack of observation and quick decision-making led them to park in a driveway causing them to receive a minor fault."
this down is that that key thing that when you're at junctions don't just look one way keep scanning both even if it's traffic just on one side because even when we join that 40 road sometimes you might get the odd occasion where something happens from the left where pedestrians start crossing in front of you or cross the road over there so just keep checking both even if it is just traffic from one side um were you familiar with the roads that we went on today yeah okay just the first uh roundabout that we did you know the big one where there was a bit of traffic yep yeah that was that that stretch i didn't actually this is the so that was the first time i was actually going for the first time now you did the roundabouts quite well you're using your mirrors in the right position you're a little cautious on them but it's okay it's not too bad some of the roundabouts the road marking was like really faded,2029.2,2076.0,917,191,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=2029,"3 - There is some traffic and potential for pedestrians crossing the road, but overall the situation is not too critical. The instructor is just reminding the learner driver to scan both ways when approaching a junction. The road markings on some roundabouts are faded, but it is not a major safety concern."
so um at times you'd go over the roundabout a lot more than you needed to but it was still because it was completely flat but it kind of kind of didn't have enough to make it a fault but yeah if you've got a raised roundabout try and go around it more because i've got a road markings which i didn't put down right at the beginning that roundabout you know the shell yeah yeah yeah you went over that with the yellow car in front of us and we went over that a bit more than we needed to okay yeah okay so we'll we'll go work on some of these things now okay so uh how many i mean like do see this one one serious mainly just the maneuver like the observation i put it down because the back tire touching wasn't that bad yeah but it was mainly the observation afterwards that it was serious also the back there touching was okay it wasn't that bad but it shouldn't have happened it shouldn't happen yeah so it,2078.639,2127.76,908,196,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=2078,"Driving situation: 6 - There were some minor faults with the driving but nothing too critical. However, the back tire touching the curb and lack of observation afterwards were serious enough to warrant improvement."
was just because it just i think i know what happened i think uh you know when i was doing the first land of observations yeah i would have you tilted you went like this exactly you went oh let me look around and then now you've turned and the other thing with the steering wheel you kind of rest your hand down here don't you no i don't mind that but some examiners may not feel comfortable to try and keep both hands on okay um with the armrest you can move it forward so that it's closer if you wanted to but yeah okay so that's the end of our video today i hope you guys learned a little bit about what's involved in the test how to observe at junctions just being a bit more careful and anytime you change directions in a maneuver keep checking around you any questions before we sum it up,2129.76,2172.56,794,167,3PpaHcVOAEk,2182,https://youtu.be/3PpaHcVOAEk?t=2129,1 - Not critical at all.

hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving my name is aman and today i'm doing a mock test for ashish hi guys ashish has his own youtube channel called the indian driving school which i will list here so in today's video it will be a mock test for sheesh now he has been driving for quite a few years even you're an experienced driver eight nine years yeah but you've never really driven in england and you've got your test coming up in two weeks time so he wanted to just get an instructor's point of view on what he should be doing if there are any mistakes anything he needs to be wary of for his um test here because driving in india is very different to driving here so he just wanted to adapt to some of the roads here yeah okay and the traffic yeah and the traffic okay so throughout the drive i want you to follow the road ahead whenever i need you to turn i will tell you in plenty of,16.64,64.0,896,191,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=16,"time, so I would rate this situation as a 2, as it is a practice/mock test and the instructor is guiding the driver throughout the drive."
time if i don't say anything keep going straight if you're not sure where you're going you can ask okay uh 20 minutes of the drive will be independent where i'm going to give you a series of directions to follow maybe some road signs to follow as well we're going to carry out one maneuver and we may also carry out the emergency stop okay all right all right so um before we get started i'm just going to ask you a question could you tell me how would you check that your directional indicators are working um if you put the indicator on inside you will see the dash and from the outside you have to go and check for the lights because you'd use the indicator from yeah from like left and right from the indicators and then you wouldn't use the hazard lights no yes why would you use the hazard light because then all your indicators indicators are working okay because it's only one side isn't it okay yeah so it's not necessarily a fault but it's just,65.76,117.6,954,196,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=65,Criticality: 1 - The driving situation is not critical at all. The instructor is simply asking a question about checking directional indicators before the lesson starts.
it's better to do that use the hazard and walk around and see if oh there will be yeah they see the signals as well yeah okay so when you're ready let's drive off and we're going to move off and then turn right into that first road up there this right here yeah hi guys and welcome back to another mock test with me ammon so today with the shish's mock test if there's any advisory faults i'll be putting them in anything minor or serious i'm going to point that across at the bottom as he's an experienced driver sometimes he takes a few risky gaps but just be careful if you're a new driver may be better to be a bit cautious if you're unsure okay so at the end of the road turn right [Music] when it comes to stopping or slowing down for junctions ashish has a bit of a habit of using the clutch first and then pressing the brake now this is coasting but provided you are breaking it's not necessarily an,118.32,183.04,907,197,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=118,Critical situation: 2 - The instructor is simply giving some tips and advice to the learner driver.
issue for the test as long as you slow down and the card doesn't actually speed up this wouldn't be counted as a fault in the test but it's not something that you want to be doing all the time as it does make you lose control of the vehicle and the car can speed up in the driving test you will be asked to pull over and pot three to four times whenever the examiner asks you to pull over don't pull over in the first space you see always look for a safe place to park if there are no safe places the examiner would usually say pull over and park anywhere don't worry about the driveways if you can pull over and park up on the left anywhere safe thank you and drive before you're ready,185.44,236.799,686,146,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=185,"4 - While it's not a critical situation, it's important to be aware of the potential fault in the driving test and not make a habit of it. The instruction on pulling over and parking safely is also important but not immediately critical."
okay now there's gonna be two roundabouts the first one turn right and the next one turn left they're very close together first one right and yeah [Music] now as you can see in the video she does have a bit of a habit of crossing over his arms on the steering wheel now again this isn't something that you want to be doing as a new driver but if you do cross your arms over on the steering wheel it's not necessarily a fault unless you lose control of the steering whilst you do it [Music],253.28,293.18,489,106,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=253,"Critical level: 3 - The situation is not very critical as it involves maneuvering through two roundabouts, but requires attention to details and proper control of the steering wheel."
to deal with the park vehicles she moves over to the middle of the road in good time making sure he's not too close on the left and also allows enough clearance for the oncoming vehicles [Music],317.36,327.59,194,41,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=317,3 - The driving situation is slightly critical because the learner is making a deliberate move to navigate around parked vehicles while ensuring proper distance from the left and accommodating oncoming traffic.
ahead from here [Music] ahead of shoes deals with the meeting situation really well allowing the vehicle in front to easily pass by slowing down over to the left hand side of the road after the vehicle has passed in the middle of the road she starts using his mirrors towards the right and moving quite a lot towards the right hand side at the same time we had a motorbike that was behind us that was also trying to move right had the motorbike been trying to overtake this would have gone down as a serious fault [Music] turn left at the roundabout [Music],347.6,403.55,557,115,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=347,Critical level: 3 - The situation is not very critical as the driver handles the meeting situation well but there is a slight concern with the motorbike behind them trying to move right.
not the traffic lights turn right [Music] she steals with this right turn really well making sure to wait in the yellow box to make the right turn he waits for the road ahead to be clear before turning safely [Music] take the next road on your left [Music] when traveling along the middle of the road with parked vehicles on both sides it's always a good idea to drive a little bit slower and to keep scanning both sides as there are a lot of parked vehicles in the road somebody may be standing in the road and you just can't see them yet ashish is driving within the speed limit scanning both sides and he's alert of anyone behind him so this wouldn't necessarily be a fault but it's something to be wary about i've put an advisory fault for observation at this junction as ashish only looks right then left and moves out it's always a good idea to look right left right at least once before you emerge out as it's very easy for,420.08,520.32,930,194,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=420,"Driving situation: 7 - The situation is fairly critical as the driver is navigating through parked vehicles where someone may be standing in the road, and the instructor has noted an advisory fault for observation at a junction where the driver only looked right then left."
motorbikes and cyclists to be hidden behind the park vehicles when we get to the roundabout turn right [Music],522.64,534.69,110,24,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=522,"4 - There is some potential for danger as motorbikes and cyclists may be hidden behind parked vehicles, but the situation does not appear to be immediately critical."
and then somewhat ashish times the approach really well making sure to slow down and turn after the oncoming vehicle so that he doesn't have to stop on the main road [Music] city at the traffic lights turn right ashish makes good use of mirrors and positions towards the right to get into the right hand lane for this turn you're allowed to cross the center line provided you're not disturbing the traffic in front as it's a broken white line ashish goes forward to make the right turn as there's space for two vehicles he pulls a bit of a risky maneuver by turning with the oncoming vehicles as they may try to turn into the overtaking loom so it may be safer to wait before turning the speed of the new road is 40 miles per hour ashish is driving up to 30 miles per hour and checking his mirrors to move back into the normal driving lane he notices a vehicle on his left so he doesn't signal he waits for them to pass,555.519,652.079,919,195,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=555,Critical level: 6 - Ashish's maneuver to make a right turn with oncoming vehicles may be risky and could potentially cause a collision.
before signaling to change lanes as he wants to be in the left-hand lane he should have just signaled even if the gap's not there straight away we're gonna go on the a4 against,654.16,662.88,176,38,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=654,"Critical level: 5.

Although signaling to change lanes is important, the situation isn't extremely critical as it seems there is some room for error."
when we get to the roundabout take this the first,688.079,690.16,49,11,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=688,"exit, the situation is a 3, as it is a standard maneuver and there doesn't seem to be much traffic."
[Music] on the last row was it 40 miles in the new road we had to switch into the right hand lane in order to go to the direction that we were headed in order to switch lane ashish maintains a really good position from the vehicle in front making sure he's allowing himself enough clearance in case he has to stop or to switch into the right hand lane [Music] in the distance we're going to be going towards brentford it's the right turn so i suggest you move into the right one safe,712.71,755.68,483,106,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=712,"I would rate the driving situation a 6, as the need to switch lanes and make a right turn requires attentiveness and caution."
the road just curves right here,782.24,783.959,31,6,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=782,Critical level: 2. The road curving is a common situation and does not pose a significant challenge to most drivers.
[Music] so [Music] ashish is generally very aware of his surroundings as he checks his mirrors throughout he goes around the island and the park cars really well making sure not to have any sudden movements on the steering wheel but also making sure not to get too close to the parked vehicles or the islands throughout the drive [Music] okay it's safe to do so i'd like you to demonstrate how you would wash the rear windscreen yeah i'm not having them in this i'll tell you where it is in a second okay okay it's usually in my guide there are two of them so it's for the lights and it's for the bike yeah no everything's on the same so it's just this one here you have to twist it down it's okay but you have to do that while you're driving twist it up downwards okay so thank you that's great then at the traffic lights turn right with most traffic light right,810.25,952.839,863,187,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=810,2 - The driving situation is not that critical as the student is demonstrating their ability to wash the rear windscreen and it's a simple driving maneuver.
turns only two vehicles can go into the middle to make the right turn so always make sure there's enough space for you before you go forward [Music] you can pull it and park up on the left along here please that's great okay shush we're now going to start the independent driving i'm going to give you a series of directions to follow okay so as we go down this road i want you to take the first road on your right right and then follow signs to hammersmith could you just repeat the instructions back to me um end of this road yeah turn right and then follow the roadmaps for hamburgers okay if you do forget you can ask okay so whenever you're ready drive off in your own time if i'm not sure for the uh route which i'm taking i can ask here you can ask me the directions again yeah yeah okay while moving off from this position nearly gets a serious fault for observation he's checking his blind spot but also rolling at the same time and,955.279,1025.36,941,200,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=955,Critical level: 6 - The situation is not extremely dangerous but it is still important to improve observation skills and avoid making similar mistakes.
the white car came out of the junction which was in his blind spot,1027.36,1029.52,66,14,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=1027,"Criticality: 8 - The situation is very critical because the white car came out of the junction in the driver's blind spot, which can potentially lead to a collision."
so,1045.52,1045.52,2,1,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=1045,"""I'm approaching an intersection with a yellow light, but I'll slow down and stop if I have to."" 

Critical level: 5 - While the situation may not be immediately dangerous, approaching an intersection with a yellow light requires caution and the potential for a more dangerous situation exists."
[Music],1101.47,1101.47,7,3,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=1101,"0 - There is no driving situation present at the moment, as the video just started and there's only music playing in the background."
with this right turn ashish gets a minor fault for response to road markings as he was waiting to turn behind the bus he should have turned into the overtaking lane as that was available or he should have carried on waiting under the bridge in the middle of the junction,1137.039,1149.039,270,53,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=1137,Criticality: 3 - The situation is not too critical as it is a minor fault that can be rectified easily.
so we're gonna go ahead on the a4 so i'd suggest you move into the middle lane,1183.28,1186.16,78,20,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=1183,"4 - This situation is slightly critical because a lane change requires attention and awareness, but it is not a highly dangerous or complicated maneuver."

so it's the 205 the following [Music] she follows his lane really well going into the right hand lane as he enters the roundabout and as he goes round the lane splits into two and he takes the first half as that will now go to the 205 the right hand lane is now the new lane for going back around the way we came,1238.159,1266.32,312,71,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=1238,"4 - The driving situation is relatively low-stress as the learner is following the lane and is on a roundabout, but attention is required to take the correct lane."
so as we go around this roundabout the lane is again splitting into two branches and we're right next to the third exit so we need to take the first half in order to be able to exit at fourth [Music] and then just turn the left,1283.2,1319.76,227,51,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=1283,"Criticality: 7

This situation is fairly critical because the driver is approaching a roundabout and must navigate the proper lane in order to successfully exit at the correct location, while also dealing with potential traffic in the roundabout."
at the end of this row turn left [Music] and if you can just pull it in park on the left anywhere along here thank you and drive off and if you're ready,1336.24,1370.159,152,36,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=1336,"Critical level: 1

This situation is not critical at all, as the instruction is just to turn left and park on the left side of the road."
take the road on the right please,1402.96,1402.96,33,7,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=1402,Critical level: 2 - This situation is not very critical because it is a simple instruction with no immediate danger present.
[Music] yep okay if you can put in a park on the left just before the white car don't worry about anything just leave enough space in front to move away easily okay okay that's great thank you okay she's what we're going to do now is i'd like you to carry out the parallel park exercise using this white car in front so i'd like you to start alongside the vehicle in the road so you're going to be nice and parallel and then reverse back and park within two car spaces try not to touch the pavement as you're doing this okay so whenever you're ready,1433.35,1487.6,549,120,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=1433,"Critical Rating: 6 - This situation is moderately critical as the driver is about to carry out a parallel park exercise which can be challenging, but there are no other cars or pedestrians immediately present."
so,1505.919,1505.919,2,1,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=1505,specific critical information is missing and a rating cannot be provided.
with parallel parking if you don't manage to get the maneuver done in one go and you have to go into first gear to go forward to fix this this will go down as a minor fault for control while reversing ashish gets the back tire quite close to the pavement i wanted to go forward to fix this he should have looked around before going forward as there was a vehicle waiting but as he wasn't close to them this wasn't a serious fault but it would be counted as a minor fault thank you so shortly we're going to carry out the emergency stop okay so i'd like you to drive normally along this road i'll make sure that it's clear so you'll see me looking around and i'm going to give you a signal which is stop as soon as you get that signal i'd like you to slow down and stop the car as quickly and as safely as possible okay i will look around our milk i will make sure it's safe you don't need to,1526.24,1580.0,891,194,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=1526,"rate the driving situation in this segment as it mainly involves discussing minor faults and preparing for an emergency stop, with no immediate danger or critical situation present."
worry about anyone being around you at the time so when you get my signal stop the car quickly okay and it doesn't matter if it's uh like stop down or like engine turns off as well or shall i destroy stop how you would normally normally that's up to you okay that's fine then okay so wait for myself just an emergency situation comes in and yeah that's exactly so we're trying to recreate that at the moment okay okay so just wait for my signal though that's the only thing so when you're ready drive off from here,1581.44,1606.32,514,109,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=1581,"2 - The driving situation is not very critical as the learner is in a controlled environment and not facing any hazards or obstacles at the moment. However, they are preparing for an emergency situation."
with the emergency stop always make sure you wait for the signal and stop the car as quickly as you can and then after the emergency stop when you're asked to move off make sure you look around over both blind spots to move off so wait for my signal before you do the stop stop that's great though thank you i'm not going to be asking you to do that again so whenever you're ready you may drive off turn right from here it is very important to look around before you move off after an emergency stop as there could very easily be somebody over in your blind spot that may move into the road as you cannot see them in your mirrors at the end turn left i want that last one here,1622.4,1687.52,676,140,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=1622,"Criticality: 7 - The situation is critical because it involves performing an emergency stop, which is a potentially dangerous situation that requires quick reflexes and proper observation before moving off again. Additionally, making a turn at the end adds to the complexity of the situation."
at the end of this row turn left and then at the roundabout turn right so the two are very close together again so this is left right yeah left from here and then right around,1715.919,1725.36,175,37,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=1715,"Criticality: 4 - The situation is not too critical, but it requires attention and a bit of planning as the turns are close together."
at the traffic last time right this crossroads is slightly staggered so the road ahead is over towards the left-hand side of the road in order to make a right turn it's very important you don't go across towards the right too far as this would block the way of anyone in front from being able to go straight ahead as ashish went forward into the traffic light junction he goes on to the yellow box but then positions more towards the right this could be an issue if anybody else ahead wanted to continue straight majority of the traffic in front all made a left turn into the same road so this wasn't really blocking anyone's way so we got fairly lucky at this traffic light [Music] if you can turn right just in here,1768.24,1816.799,717,146,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=1768,"7 - The driving situation is critical as a mistake in turning right could potentially block the way of other vehicles going straight ahead, potentially causing an accident."

on the junction ahead ashish gets a minor fault for junction observation as he did not check towards the right before entering at the roundabout the roundabout does have a bit of an open approach with some railings and trees on the right hand side it's still a good idea to look across to the right before you enter as it's very easy to miss motorbikes and cyclists here along this road ashish deals with the meeting situations really well as there are part vehicles on both sides he stops in the middle allowing enough clearance for the cars in front to easily get around him as the part vehicles are on both sides at the exact same point neither side has priority so one side will have to give way and take the next roll on the left just here left yeah there's a small little entrance,1889.679,1950.64,786,158,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=1889,
we're just going to pull over and park up on the left hand side of the road just just keep going a little bit further just pan that van will be great yep it's just in the shade over there [Music] okay just just go ahead of the van if you can sorry parking spaces are a bit funny on this road just to hear that black car be great thank you that's great there is she she can secure the car and then switch off the engine okay so that's the end of your test how do you feel like you did i failed i think why do you think you failed few things i realized like maybe one of the speeding thing it just comes 21 22 sometimes because i wouldn't worry about that too much yeah or one it's tall but it was fine as well okay so um overall really good drive mm-hmm but unfortunately it wouldn't be a pass on this occasion emergency stop was not okay i think it,1987.6,2053.76,848,189,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=1987,
would it's to do with the emergency stop that's the reason why you found it oh yeah i think so it wasn't that great okay i know the emergency stop wasn't great but you did stop so that was fine it's what you did after the emergency stop you didn't look back you didn't look around yeah i look under just a minute i just saw you looking in that mirror on this one a little bit but there's no checks now it's it's really sad that you failed for the emergency stop because the drive was really good okay i know there are a few faults here and there you were sort of doubting yourself a little bit okay i want to go over some of the faults because i was trying to get you to do loads of right turns because there was something with the right turn which i was trying to really sort of nail into them because there's a few chances where i felt like you were about to make a mistake and we kind of got lucky that nobody turned up on some of the,2056.0,2098.32,937,203,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=2056,
encounters so i'm going to go over those with you was it like when the double lines are i checked on that one that one and sometimes i think i miss on the game like looking back you don't look back here but when you're when you're looking you're kind of going over the line and looking and i felt like if somebody had been on the left as you're looking right you might have a bit more trouble so make sure when you're coming over giveaway lines as soon as you're crossing that line before you've crossed you should have already have looked right left right at least once you kind of you get to that line you go right and then you're moving left as you're doing it okay yeah um but besides that there's a few um a few things i want to go over so moving off safety after the emergency stop no no that one's over here so moving off safety so this was earlier remember when i said to you we're going to start the independent,2099.599,2146.8,920,197,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=2099,
driving now where we were parked there was a junction on your right just there where that white keyer came out okay so we were parked on the side of road of a road on the single yellow line yeah okay when i said to you move off you got ready you looked around you checked your blind spot but there's a car right there and that car was moving as you were rolling now that could have very easily been a serious fault because you're looking and moving what if he doesn't see you and he doesn't really think of you as a concern you should have you shouldn't have been moving there okay because you're moving so slowly and the road's quite big it wasn't a big issue but now had you moved off a bit faster i would have had to break or even tell you to stop on that point okay okay okay so it's the fact that you're moving into the road and he's moving into the road at the exact same time okay you are looking but you're also moving,2148.079,2194.8,926,200,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=2148,

waiting there for a bit and then you didn't leave your indicator on and he's sort of gone through okay yeah yeah uh but yeah your speed wasn't that much of a big issue because the road wasn't for that long and then you did realize which is great um junction observation just now on that roundabout that we just did that left turn the turn for us is quite easy and you i know you can see through the railings through the hedges a little bit but you didn't really look right now if somebody had been coming through that would have been a bigger issue is this when we turned left and there was a roundabout yeah the roundabout where we turned left just now back there okay your reverse park initially it started off very good and then you had a control and an observation fault on that one control being because you got close to the back you had to go forward now you could have finished the whole thing in one go yeah okay because you've had to go forward it's now resulted in a in a,2244.0,2294.24,981,204,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=2244,
control minor which is okay the observation mining i just went forward because i thought the rear tire might touch the because it was like very close to the curb yeah we did actually have some space okay but it was okay that you wanted to go forward no problem but while doing it if i'm one you can lower the mirror i can lower the mirror okay okay so with the reverse park it was great but it's just because you've had to go forward you still get a minor fault okay okay and then your control oh sorry observation on that i've given you a minor on that because when you went forward you did look but there was a car passing at the same time but it was okay but when you started reversing again from that point you didn't look okay so every time you change direction you need to check because things have changed all the six ways okay yeah the the stall earlier in second gear um was in the red light when it was in the second okay i thought it would be fine,2296.24,2348.48,958,196,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=2296,
but yeah it's taller it will be fine if you accelerate and hold the biting point for a little while it's just another card as well but if you're completely stationary i'm going to try in the first term that's it yeah okay um this one here is a bit of a funny one because um earlier there was a road where we had parked cars on the right this was your first ever mistake there was a road but there were parked cars on the right and we're going through and then there was a car approaching now there was space for both of you but as he's approached you moved left and slowed down which is fine but there's a motorbike behind us and you've moved he's moved in behind you but then now that the car's gone through instead of just going straight you've moved right but you're checking your mirrors and moving and the motorbike's also moving around at the same time okay so we didn't need to move like that even though you're trekking,2350.16,2395.04,927,198,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=2350,
it's just like it's not necessary to move and be mindful about checking and moving at the same time because you're not kind of reacting to what's there you're sort of just checking and moving because that motorbike what if he tried to get around you a bit quicker there okay yeah so these are some things to bear in mind but in terms of safety the roundabouts and all that the right turns you did really well you were always trying to get into the normal driving lane which is great you kind of definitely knew about that one one thing i realized when there was entrance left yeah i shouldn't have moved actually it was okay yeah yeah i know what you were about there was no any other car so i think that was okay as well true but at the same time that entry that you're thinking about they have a giveaway okay so they have to wait for you it's not a it's not a slip road not a slipper yeah so i'm glad you realize that but on that particular one,2397.04,2444.4,947,200,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=2397,
they have a giveaway on the way down so if they see you coming they should be stopping anyways yeah all right but that was a tricky one for them yeah so so just now near the end there was a right turn at the traffic lights yeah this one yeah yeah and um we had to wait in the middle in the yellow box which is fine but as you waited in the yellow box you put yourself really close to where you want to go but now we got and there was the red light behind the bus was it talking about it was on the right yeah yeah okay but um when we're waiting in the middle you can't go all the way forward because now the cars in front if they happen to be going straight they're having to go around you aren't they now all of the cars in front you got lucky they were turning left but if anybody was coming straight they would have been a little bit pissed off because you're in that space in this place yeah okay so although you need to,2446.079,2490.0,924,197,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=2446,
turn right you should have just gone forward and waited whereas you went like that i know what you're talking about now yeah all of them were returning yeah they turned into the same road after that i turned that as well but if there was coming straight you would have had trouble there so that could have very easily been a serious fault as well so you've got to think about where are they going to go from make sure you're not in their space because it's all good and well us getting into a great position for ourselves yeah but we can't block them at the same time okay okay but overall you do know what you're doing there isn't a lot to do which is great but it's more about safety thinking about your side of the road being a little bit more alert of your surroundings and not trying to get going straight away how about the observations while driving as well yeah generally all of that was great yeah so there's not much on that really no,2491.92,2532.56,944,191,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=2491,
just at the very beginning i felt like because you're an experienced driver i felt like um on the approach the turns and the crossings and stuff you're a little fast so if we had somebody that's turned up and they wanted to cross because there were a few occasions where we had pedestrians near crossings but they didn't cross so if they wanted to cross and then you saw them i felt like we would have had a harsher break okay because you're not prepared enough to be able to stop okay we'll work on that now though so i hope you guys enjoyed that video so i hope you guys learned a little bit about what's involved in the practical driving test and even as an experienced driver you may make mistakes you've just got to really get to know the car and the road a little bit as well yeah all right is that what you expected the result today not really but yeah um feel shame on the emergency stop thing yeah but i feel bad giving you a serious fault that but overall yeah overall was fine yeah all,2534.88,2585.359,996,203,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=2534,

hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving my name is simon and today i'm doing a mock test with emily now emily's been learning to drive with me for about i think two months just over i can't believe it's been that long oh yeah okay yeah so we're doing a bit of an intensive drive we've been driving uh we've probably done about just 25 hours 26 hours or so and her test is in just under a week just over a week's time actually and this is our second mock test now in the first mock test she made a bit of a serious fault she's a bit of a perfectionist kind of the reason why she messed up um yeah she kind of dwells on the mistakes once she's so even if it's a minor fault she gets held up on it and that's something that we're trying to get over at the moment but yeah you're allowed up to 15 minor mistakes remember that okay,16.24,61.6,832,193,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=16,
all right so throughout the drive follow the road ahead whenever i need you to turn i'll tell you if i don't say anything keep going straight we're going to do one maneuver and we may carry out the emergency stop okay all right yeah and another thing she doesn't like driving in silence i'm so bad at it so yeah we're gonna drive for about half an hour 40 minutes at most um her test is in a different area from where we're driving today today is just all about just being able to cope with any type of roads roundabouts slip roads and stuff like that yes cool okay let's start let's go it's a driver point of view ready hi guys and welcome back to another mock test now today's mock test is with emily now she is a very good driver so today's fruit is a mixture of crossroads and roundabouts so that when emily has her real driving test next week she can deal with any challenging roads and be well prepared to pass her test,63.76,132.239,925,199,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=63,
[Music] when it comes to dealing with motorbikes and city centers always be wary as motorbikes usually swerve in and out around traffic and they might move in front of you suddenly in traffic like this always be aware of your surroundings so keep an eye on your top mirror and side mirrors to make sure if there are any motorbikes around you you know exactly where they are,136.42,166.56,373,78,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=136,

screen so while waiting in this position for the driver ahead of us to turn right it's really important to check mirrors towards the left a cyclist would still get through that space and also look out for motorbikes,248.72,285.36,215,42,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=248,

well it's safe to do so i'd like you to demonstrate how you would switch on the radio mr yeah you can turn it off thank you take the next road on your right,370.88,387.68,156,36,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=370,
on approach to this right turn emily moves into the middle of the road making sure that she's fully in the central reservation and waits in a good position before turning,411.039,418.24,170,33,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=411,
here emily deals with the meeting situations really early making sure that she gives herself enough space from the white car ahead always try to maintain at least two car lengths in front so it's easy to move out from this position,434.4,444.319,231,44,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=434,
approaching the bend towards the right emily positions over towards the left hand side of the road in case there's an oncoming airport along this road emily maintains good clearance all around making sure she's leaving enough space from the island as well as the parked cars,473.919,497.199,274,53,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=473,

as we moved off to turn left at these traffic lights emily nearly gets a serious fault for response to traffic lights as she turns into the new road there is a traffic light which is red which is not for us and it's for the road behind as nobody followed us closely behind and she didn't affect anyone this didn't go down as a serious fault but you shouldn't stop for that traffic light as it's not for you,552.0,572.48,406,86,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=552,

[Music] so [Music] if you can pull over and park on the left just behind the black couch leave enough space to move away all right so we're going to start the independent driving from here i'm going to give you a series of directions to follow okay i'd like you to go up to the very end of this road turn left and then at the traffic lights turn right okay so at the end where are we going yes and then right at the traffic okay i will give you some more directions after that okay okay and if you forget your candles okay okay whenever you're ready,640.37,714.079,549,118,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=640,
so,748.32,748.32,2,1,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=748,
isn't these traffic lights where i go right no so this is just a pedestrian crossing oh right yeah so i'm turning from the main junction traffic lights again [Music],785.6,825.27,165,35,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=785,
at this traffic-like direction when the traffic lights go green you need to go into the yellow box and wait in the middle until it's safe to turn once you're in the middle there is no traffic light so you simply need to wait for the road ahead to be visibly clear before you can turn the traffic opposite that's turning right would usually go before you as you can see here the vehicle ahead didn't come into the yellow box junction if they carry on waiting in this position when the traffic lights go red they'll have to stay there as it's not safe to enter [Music] emily waits for the road ahead to be clear before turning right but the van behind her uses the horn as she moves off a little bit slower this causes her to stall the engine emily reacted really quickly and soon moves off so this would not be counted as a major fault [Music],841.519,915.98,842,175,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=841,
now when we get to the mini round about turn right okay and then follow sign stains stains,942.72,946.56,90,18,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=942,
chief it's like i'm gonna be hit by a freaking truck my anxiety right now sky high lucky i took my pill i honestly thought i'd mixed up my left and right again i was like is this guy on my right sorry charles you can carry on talking i just can't respond it's like me talking to myself crazy those stains right look out sorry like on the wrong way no no okay i haven't been any signs here though [Music] if stupid [Music],980.72,1074.67,421,96,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=980,

okay i suggest you stay on the right as you exit okay,1130.08,1132.0,53,12,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=1130,
ahead of us there is a slip road joining with vehicles approaching at 50 miles per hour emily notices the vehicles approaching and makes good use of her mirrors and moves into the middle lane to make space for them another option would be to adjust your speed either by speeding up or slowing down to make space for them oh shoot oh no that's fine was that the sign stains are still ah okay cool breathe breathe at this next slip road the vehicle approaching is more or less at the same speed so emily was able to just adjust her speed by gently stepping off the accelerator or braking a little bit to accommodate for them,1168.16,1233.52,622,122,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=1168,

sustains is the a308 a308 emily starts off this roundabout really well starting in the right hand lane for stains as we went round the roundabout the right hand lane moves away from the roundabout and then splits into two lanes emily goes for the far right lane which no longer goes towards her exit as she deals with it safely by using her mirrors and waiting for a safe opportunity to move into the left-hand lane this would not be a big issue,1313.2,1336.96,445,94,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=1313,
changing lanes in a roundabout like this with flowing traffic on the left can sometimes be really tricky so always try and position towards the left when your exit's coming up [Music] okay that's the end of your independent driving i'm gonna give you directions just normal from now on okay [Music] once you're on the exit always try and move back to the left-hand lane when safe as we're still in the overtaking loom as the traffic's not really moving this isn't necessarily a fault at the moment but try and move back unsafe [Music],1358.559,1408.73,534,113,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=1358,
i'm going straight here yeah [Music] okay now the next set of traffic lights turn left [Music] okay awesome [Music],1426.64,1446.67,115,27,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=1426,

so on approach to the hazard ahead emily uses her mirrors and signals right to get around the van the signal was slightly misleading as there were two junctions on the right hand side had somebody been in any of those two junctions this would have gone down as a serious fault as this signal would be very misleading that she's turning into that road rather than going around the van you would simply need to just use your mirrors make sure the road ahead is clear and just move around without a signal,1521.84,1556.32,502,98,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=1521,
when joining a slip road when you're coming in from an angle it's always very important to lean forward and use the right hand mirror to make sure that nobody is in your blind spot,1577.279,1584.88,180,37,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=1577,
okay we're going to be coming off at heathrow on this next one so we're taking the exit okay when we get to the roundabout we'd like you to turn right third exit on this dual carriageway the lane that we're on already comes off the dual carriageway so you wouldn't need a signal in order to take the exit,1604.24,1625.679,304,74,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=1604,

my emily gets marked down for hesitation on this roundabout as she does miss a safe gap but she takes the next available gap so this wouldn't be a serious fault as we went into this round about to take the third exit emily does make a serious fault with her signal times she's in position to take the third exit but then just before the exit she turns off the signal and goes past [Music] this one we've taken the wrong answer oh blah sorry sorry i knew it was the one before and then i was like okay good job mate you can just turn right at those traffic lights,1692.48,1747.279,562,120,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=1692,
going the wrong way at that roundabout wasn't the big issue the bigger issue was we were signaling and already in position to exit and suddenly we're going past the exit and this signal is very misleading,1766.64,1776.72,204,40,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=1766,
stop there you have your own traffic light i'm so dumb it's literally red like why my second guest relax yeah oh sorry i'm so dumb but like i literally stopped okay shut up everyone's gonna be like this girl is crazy there we go okay see now we can go come on [Music] oh shoot it's mine sorry i'm sorry i'm stop talking just make a right turn we'll talk about it later okay,1793.6,1839.279,373,85,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=1793,

i'm not in here am i you happy to leave it there yeah secure the car you're in the space you done having a little meltdown yeah all right so let's talk actually so let's talk about how that went okay i failed give me a second okay so that's the end of your test so how would you say that went for you uh really bad okay why exactly because i just kept making mistakes and i knew i made one like right at the beginning i knew i made a mistake and then from that point i was like oh well all right what would you say was your serious fault within when i tried to turn right and it was red well just now yeah that was a biggie uh i think i made one earlier as well when exactly i can't remember i just know i screwed it up all right these traffic lights were at the very end that was a very silly fault but that was a serious thought because now the light in front of you is clearly red and you said,1906.24,1966.08,896,196,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=1906,
oh should i go and i didn't say anything and then you started moving forward and i have to tell you that like i literally had stopped before i was like oh yeah it's not my light and then i started going idiot i'm just dumb yeah so that was the first thing and then when the lights went green you kind of went forward and stopped and that's wrapping in front's clearly not going you've got a filter arrow you need to turn immediately yeah the guy behind had to hook you so again that would have been a serious response to traffic lights again okay now all your serious thoughts happened right at the very end this traffic light obviously but there's one more which was your signal timed on that last roundabout now we're in position to turn right third exit you've moved into the right-hand lane as you're about to exit you've moved into the left-hand lane you're approaching with the left indicator the exits right in front of you just before you've taken the exit you've,1967.919,2014.08,971,198,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=1967,
now turned it off and you've gone back round now that signal is very misleading now nobody was affected in this case but there was a call on our right now what if he wanted to try and exit and then the guys on the exit they could have come out in front of you thinking oh look she's leaving let me go out yeah and now you've gone back around so at that point you should have just taken the exit even if you feel like oh i'm taking the wrong exit just carry on okay yeah i knew it was that exit and then i just was like nah yeah that's that's the only fault i've got so that roundabout and then that traffic light so the last like five minutes besides this it was very good you were doing really well genuinely genuinely i didn't have any other serious faults until that round about now okay i thought i'd failed earlier no you haven't let me let me go over some of the other faults though that you're probably thinking about um,2015.519,2069.28,927,197,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=2015,
so i've got the moving off control where you stalled in that traffic light yeah yeah so the lights were green you went into the yellow box you actually went into the correct position the guy in front of us however he kind of waited at the stop line still he should have come forward as well now when you were waiting in the middle there were really no chances for you to turn and then when the traffic in front cleared you just sat there and now the guy had behind you're about to move and the guy behind who did you usually hear me so yeah so a bit of hesitation on the moving on that one and then um the stall happened at the exact same spot yeah and then the roundabout you know where the lorry came in from the left yeah really fast now you didn't do anything wrong there it was just his speed was too fast he actually sort of put his hand up as sorry yeah he did um but are you dealt with that all nicely on this roundabout just now hesitation,2070.879,2116.72,948,197,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=2070,
we have that clear gap and as it were as it sort of went past you were like yeah yeah so that was a gap that you could have taken but it's all minor faults um oh this was one that nearly went into a serious fault okay now right earlier remember when i said to you we're gonna start the independent drive now yeah and i said to you at the end of this road turn left traffic lights turn right yeah so we we did that bit and then we got to the end of the road where there was a traffic light where we were turning left as we've turned left at this oh and then i slammed on the brakes and it was you were about to had you break any firmer had the lady behind carried on in the same direction as us that would have gone down to a dangerous thoughts right so what's that traffic light for you nah who was that traffic light for those guys on the main road yeah i just saw red and i was like but your break was,2118.56,2169.68,903,196,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=2118,
very brief so i went down as like a minor fault on that one had the lady behind turned in or was affected in any way whatsoever yeah that would have been a serious fault yeah so if if you turn into a new road and there is a traffic light there'll be a clear stop line if that traffic light is for you now usually with them traffic lights as soon as you turn into a new road they're not immediately after the turn there'll be space for at least one if not two cars to be more straight so as you turn in if you get a glimpse of that light it's not for you okay so don't panic yeah well what did you think it was your serious fault besides these i thought at that traffic light well when you got hooted at that one yeah and then also when i like pressed on the brakes yeah and then i kept going and i was like good on me but i knew i was taking you on a really challenging drive i did i did kind of,2172.0,2223.68,895,197,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=2172,
test it with the slip roads and the roundabouts and all that sort of stuff so overall good just at the end don't let it go i didn't i'm so i just was i don't know i knew it wasn't good from the beginning but the drive was fine up until this round about the end yeah i kind of gave up now what have we talked about not good i know when it comes to doing a mock drive even if i'm sitting there in silence and i've not said anything and you feel like you've made a mistake you sit there overthinking it now in the test the examiner's not gonna go oh no it's okay they can't answer they're not gonna sit there trying to pacify you yeah so you've just gotta think okay well whatever carry on okay cool yeah let it go yeah okay it's all right it's a learning curve now we've got another week yeah to correct some of these things don't give up yeah,2225.839,2278.56,841,192,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=2225,
that's what i'm going to take away from this one [Music] okay that's the end of our mock test today i hope you guys learned a little bit about what's involved in the test and i did pick a bit of a challenging route for emily that's because i need her to really get out of this mindset where she kind of freezes if i'm not helping her and starts to overthink yeah all right thank you [Music],2279.44,2310.94,390,90,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=2279,
[Music] how are you feeling today terrified all right i'm gonna start now all right you got it hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving today it's emily's test day and today we're gonna do a mock test for the next sort of 40 minutes or so we're just going to go on a variety of roads near the test center and just a mixture of things again we're going to try and get through all the maneuvers if possible and then hopefully she'll have enough time to recover afterwards okay you ready yeah i'm ready okay okay so throughout the drive i want you to follow the road ahead whenever i need you to turn i'll tell you in plenty of time if i don't say anything keep going straight if you're not sure you can always ask okay we're gonna try and get through a few of the maneuvers today but in the test it will usually just be one okay and possibly the emergency stop as well now before we get started could you tell me um,0.1,66.08,918,198,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=0,
about the general condition of your tires what should be the general condition of your tires for your tyres to be roadworthy um so there should be like no holes or like crevices in them and the treadmill should be 1.6 millimeters okay sounds good okay so when you're ready let's get started yeah is that right yeah,67.84,81.92,314,67,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=67,
hi guys and welcome back to clearview so now this mock test was recorded an hour before emily's actual test so the results will be up at the end of this video there are various tips throughout the videos on what you should be doing in the driving test even if you go the wrong way how to deal with it safely thank you for watching be sure to like comment and subscribe to the channel let's turn left just in here,98.32,121.2,412,86,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=98,
at the roundabout turn right emily deals with the mini roundabout really well going slowly round the roundabout she does get the back tire touching over the roundabout but that's safe as there isn't really enough space to go around it completely,139.04,156.4,245,49,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=139,
a right signal wouldn't be necessary as it was very clear that she was waiting for the oncoming traffic only signal right if it's unclear what you're doing or if you're hidden between traffic that vehicles in front or behind may not be able to see you emily gets marked down for hesitation as there was plenty of space ahead to carry on before the next oncoming vehicle as they could have moved over to the right to give way to us also it's very important to try and keep making progress as you're driving as well as give way when safe [Music] with meeting situations on roads like this if there's enough space try and always adjust your speed so that you can slow down instead of having to stop and start constantly if there's less space then slow down switch back into first gear and stop in good time always try and allow at least two car length space in front to easily move out but if there's very little space then leave at least half a car length [Music],176.72,255.43,961,198,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=176,
if you i think travel's gonna be ready,266.72,280.24,38,9,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=266,
[Music] at the end of the road turn left [Music] along this new road the park vehicles on the right hand side of the road so we do have more priority but if the vehicles in front are already committed then you should wait for them but if there's enough space you can continue emily handles this type narrow gap with the van really well [Music] emily waits for a really safe gap on this new road there are two lanes on this new road but as you turn from this position you're more likely to swing out into the second lane so if somebody's in the second lane it's safer to wait for both lanes to be clear before emerging,307.67,365.039,617,133,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=307,
i'd suggest you use the middle lane we're going to be on this road for a little while,402.639,405.919,85,20,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=402,
we're gonna take the next exit coming off at ricely okay now when we get to the roundabout to turn right to that exit piece,429.039,447.84,123,28,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=429,
[Music] take the next road on your right please on approach to this right turn as emily goes forward there is a keep clear sign on the floor she should have won slightly ahead of the keep clear and waited the back of her car was partially on the keep clear signs so this would have gone down as a minor fault for response to road markings now as nobody was actually affected by this this would not go down as a serious fault with this right turn we had to wait in the middle of the road for a little while as there were no safe gaps in front to be able to turn when you're waiting in the middle of the road for a right turn most times one of the vehicles in front may flash their headlights and slow down for you so keep waiting until you have a safe opportunity and somebody gives way or until the road is clear,491.16,556.8,812,168,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=491,
you can pull in and park up on the left okay so we're going to start the independent driving now i'm going to give you a series of directions to follow so at the end of this road turn right when we get to the end of that road turn left and then i'll give you some signs to follow afterwards yeah so right left side yeah okay okay so if you forget you can ask okay okay so whenever you're ready [Music],579.92,615.64,401,89,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=579,
okay we're now going to follow signs towards heathrow for a little while emily has a really good approach to roundabouts she slows down approaching in second gear giving herself enough time to look across see if there's a safe gap and to be able to continue without hesitation,688.399,712.639,276,55,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=688,
[Music] on approach to this roundabout he throws a sign posted as the third exit which is past 12 o'clock as she goes forward she starts in the right hand lane now the right hand lane splits into two and both parts of the right hand lane go towards heathrow as emily goes into the roundabout she goes into the furthest lane closest to the roundabout which no longer goes towards heathrow whenever you're driving if you notice that you get into the wrong lane you can use your mirrors and signal and safely move into the left-hand lane but if anyone's around you or you're unsure it's safer to stay in the lane and just go around again i'm just gonna go around again if you're ever traveling in the wrong direction and you know you're going the wrong way try to stay nice and relaxed because going the wrong way it's not going to affect anyone around you but suddenly changing direction could be dangerous for others around you,741.92,808.959,926,193,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=741,
at this point emily should have just,824.639,824.639,36,8,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=824,
at this point emily should have just taken the exit right in front of her which is where we came in she checks her mirrors and switches into the lane on the right which was clear so this wouldn't go down as a fault but she was intending to move over into the fourth lane to go round the roundabout which could be quite dangerous as it's hard to see across all those lanes i'm really sorry it's okay i've taken the complete wrong one it's okay i was not in the red lane at any point for any of the accidents i'll just carry on this way for a little while okay i don't even know well technically you've come around and taken the sixth stage i have no idea i was like i'm just gonna go round again and then i realized i had no idea like where to start counting the exits from again and then i was in the wrong length and he used to be in the closest one because otherwise all the closest leaves are,824.639,889.68,895,193,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=824,
just going to take me off and then i was like right we're just going to take the wrong one then because it was not safe to change lanes you're not going to tell me anything are you i hate this i hate this i should have gone in the middle name and i just went in the far right one and i don't really know why but i did it and then from that point onwards it was like no because i actually did see the sign shut up okay what do i do now i'm giving you directions don't worry have i failed the independent driving bit it doesn't matter if you go the wrong way okay as long as you don't feel like you've done anything wrong i don't think i did anything then relax and breathe okay yeah and then left ear [Music],890.959,947.98,707,158,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=890,
okay so we're now taking the exit for heathrow okay [Music],969.12,974.01,59,16,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=969,
so [Music],1003.12,1004.7,10,4,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=1003,
good vibes [Music],1024.799,1033.15,18,5,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=1024,
all right that'll be the end of your independent driving with thank god from now on sorry okay so at the next roundabout i'd like you to turn right that exit okay,1048.88,1057.6,162,35,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=1048,
[Music],1081.17,1081.17,7,3,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=1081,
emily enters this roundabout really well as she sees the second exit directly in front she starts using her mirrors and moving towards the island and signals as she reaches the island in order to take the exit [Music] take the next road on your right,1107.679,1131.44,250,50,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=1107,
[Music] you can pull in and park up on the left please thank you driver whenever you're ready,1150.05,1178.72,93,21,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=1150,
[Music] so turn right at the round bar [Music] if you could pull over and park on the right hand side of the road don't worry about the driveways on this occasion just anywhere along the right will be okay [Music] thank you what i'd like you to do now is to reverse back for about two car lengths keeping reasonably close to in parallel with the pavement as you carry out the exercise okay with parking on the right hand side of the road always try and maintain about a tyre's width of space when you parked so that when you're reversing you don't end up closing that space as emily was reversing back she slightly tilted the wheel towards the pavement and her back tire does touch the pavement but because she moves it away straight away this wouldn't be a serious spot but this would go down as a minor fault thank you travel for whenever you're ready,1229.38,1324.24,853,176,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=1229,
[Music] if you could pull in and park up just before the van don't worry about the drives just leave enough space to move away [Music] thank you drama for you already,1347.72,1374.48,166,37,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=1347,

you're right there i'm very serious all of a sudden relax oh i really need a back massage,1429.2,1436.799,89,20,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=1429,
going ahead from here approaching this roundabout to go ahead second exit emily approaches from the left-hand lane and then goes into the middle there are no safe gaps to go into the roundabout straight away so she has to wait as she's waiting she does take the right gap but she's a little bit too slow to move in so you'll either need to move off a little bit quicker or wait for a safer gap before entering [Music] we're gonna go right into the car park okay [Music] now we're gonna go ahead from this round now okay [Music] just let me laugh okay if you can just fold back into any space on your left,1467.12,1546.48,604,133,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=1467,
i need you again okay,1580.32,1580.32,21,5,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=1580,
that's great thank you okay so that's the end of the test nearer the end you were kind of getting a little worked up on some of the little things again okay but let's just talk about the main thing so far so that would have been a pass okay but there was one what two things the first one being that roundabout where you kind of went the wrong way but it wasn't the fact that you went the wrong way it's what you kind of tried to do near the end you said oh i'm going the wrong way i'm going to go around and i'll say okay and i thought we ended up taking the fifth exit which is where we came in but then you've switched over which was safe but then you tried to switch over again and i thought oh if she goes for that space it was a black mercedes veto that would have been an issue but you stopped yourself yeah that was really good going the wrong way absolutely no problem stay calm okay okay,1602.799,1648.559,897,195,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=1602,
the other one's a very silly one because i asked you to park up and you kind of just parked in the road you're not really on the side okay you know you know that bit where the width restriction was that bit yeah did you realize yeah because the guy behind me yeah he thought i was like waiting for someone and so he waited behind me and then i was like i don't think i'm far enough it was very brief that bit because i told you to move off and because you'd indicated he waited yeah but had that caused anyone else to any more trouble that would have been a serious fault there why did you try and stop immediately anyways yeah i don't know there was another space up there when i said park up i thought oh she can go up to that car but you kind of try and try to park up right near the roadwork sign and now the van in front was still yeah he had to slow down a bit as well so it's just,1650.399,1693.52,887,194,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=1650,
yeah that was just silly yeah use the car in front as your guide and roll into that space okay yeah the parking on the right you did touch the back tire so that'll be a control issue but you kind of moved it away quickly so it was literally she just tapped and then we went now but why is it even that close we're not parking you're just reversing so leave about a drain width and just maintain it yeah yeah okay so you've got your test in about ten minutes time you ready for this no i should be fine you can do this yeah yeah going the wrong way absolutely no problem okay okay yeah do my little dances after all that yes um so she only really had one fault which was a uh tool but i right i literally turned out the test center and it was the first left turn to literally go on to a roundabout actually was not the red bat but it was like the ghost yeah and i just stalled and i was like oh mate like what have you done here but,1695.76,1763.6,931,199,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=1695,
besides that the examiner did say that was an exceptional drive really good she was really happy with it um and the other thing the examiner did mention at the end as well is you kind of moved on from that yeah which is really good because that's usually what she does see lily's job has also been like therapy for me i've just learned so much now it's been a really good drive all done i know you made some mistakes in the like the drive beforehand but you know [Applause] i'm a bit sad about that no one's gonna be able to watch my meltdowns anymore you're not gonna be able to tell me like emily i have a breather like chill now really well done well thank you very much it's been a pretty good job so that's the end of emily's lessons thank you for following her journey and thank you for watching bye guys [Music],1766.48,1821.22,818,183,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=1766,

it's nowhere near as nice as this and that goes newer what's going on how did this happen i think that little bit extra maybe a little bit actually yeah the amg version ah we're swapping right now damn all right so you ready to get started i'm ready as i'll ever be okay um i've done a mock test with another instructor before and i failed horrifically i don't want to have a repeat of the same so warning do not attempt any root information okay agree to that screen sadly it's not touch screen oh the one thing my card does better finally yeah all right yeah got a sat nav are you just going to direct me i'm going to give you you're going to give me directions ah are we on a traffic signs route oh it's even worse people say don't they that they hate would hate to get a route that follows signs sometimes yeah but then some people prefer it so hopefully all the uh i say it's like,113.36,170.4,885,191,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=113,
swings and roundabouts because if you're following a route with signs what kind of a route is it going to be if you're following signs you're going to have to be on a long main road so it's going to be a sign that takes you on to another long main road not all that intricate stuff you get from a satellite okay so whenever you're ready let's get started mercedes handbrake in the wrong place drive on when i'm ready okay cool so i'm ready i'm just gonna take a deep breath because it's the start of my driving test and i'm doing a six point check even though that's not really necessary do you tell people to do a six point check sorry i'm just observing now with the six point check here as long as um you've checked towards the road it's good oh that's a big bump as long as you do your right mirror yeah and the right blind spot so it'll be top right mirror and blind spot is what i'll say will be,172.08,217.68,901,203,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=172,
vital people love to be super thorough though and do the six point check and then the examiner is like let's just get on with it come on sometimes it's just like oh let's check and then there'll be one car approaching and then they start again yeah yeah yeah all right so we're gonna go left out of here when we get to the roundabout let's turn left it's the first thing okay cool left first exit i'm repeating it to myself in my head so that i've really nailed down that instruction because you can't ask again but then the examiner goes i said left duh right have you ever seen that on moody examiners like that they hate helping yeah some of them most of them are nice actually yeah yeah maybe they are up north i'm joking they're all nice they're all super nice this is the thing people think of examiners as like these really scary ogre type people or like the police or something but they're not they're so,219.44,268.639,912,197,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=219,
nice they don't want you to fail imagine being an examiner and going into work and thinking i'm just going to fail everyone today that doesn't happen does it uh no not always well you know a couple that just want to fail everyone sometimes i feel like they're in a bit of a bad mood but okay i like i'm a driving instructor i know what i'm doing these guys a head is going at 37 miles an hour i'm just going to kick it are we leaving at the next i could say anything i was trying to be like yeah look at me i'm so good at driving look at me overtaking that we get that with experienced drivers as soon as they get in and the person in front is doing like ten under they're trying to go straight around yeah okay i'm gonna indicate at the second countdown marker for 200 yards and be prepared to leave the dual carriageway not gonna rush this too much because i don't know what's ahead but i'm not,270.72,322.24,896,199,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=270,
going to start slowing down until i'm on the slip road that's what this liquid is for right for slowing down not slowing down on the drill carefully because then the car behind you has to slow down yeah no the roundabout take the third exit right okay aussie green what does that say aussie green aussie garvin who's obviously garvin i have no idea you know i'm not from manchester i'm not from mount here i have no idea where we're going have no idea where we are at so this is like because you know people take driving tests anywhere now it's so hard to find a driving test yeah they just book it for anywhere is that a good idea or no yes and no um if you're quite a confident driver then yes that should be fine but if you are a new driver you kind of need to get used to the roads a little bit i feel like it's always a good a good idea to practice a little bit in the area for,323.6,371.919,882,196,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=323,
sure which i haven't done yeah well if you got here on time this morning no it was like five minutes late oh no it was like an hour late right yeah i didn't realize it at this point the second exit is directly ahead of us so francis should have been checking his mirrors to move towards the left to take the exit he starts checking his mirrors signaling and moving at the exact same time causing the vehicle behind to slow down uh third exit that's the next one she didn't see that did you see that she didn't see it how was that for you francis how is it for me well uh interesting i change lanes with a good signal i'm leaving at the next exit life is good right if an examiner asks you how was it then you're going to say it was great right she's not even marking it so it's fine i know i'm too close to the vehicle in front i'll take the minor on the chin but we're still rocking and rolling so it's cool,373.68,432.8,908,200,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=373,
[Music] off the signal let's fall i feel like i'm not concentrating as hard as i should be there's not a driving license on the line so the question for you would you class that one as a miner which one that mistake with the vehicle behind just that oh she did see here oh she's got the second mirror damn it amman um i would say i'm gonna go straight all right straight here and i'll always tell you whenever i need you to turn okay um i would say with the vehicle behind i was signaling he saw at least two clicks of the signal before i moved across he was moving across as well right we're gonna allow that should we let the people decide guys comment below pass fell what do you reckon have you got a back camera can they see what happened if we had that on there you definitely would i start getting some stuff you'd be sweating right now some stick from youtube yeah it's actually um one of the hardest harder test centers around here i think,434.05,494.24,948,198,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=434,
the pass rate's fairly low here how fairly low like i haven't looked at everyone completely yeah most of them are below 50. that's 40 here look at that wicked kick it uh overtake on the bus we're good with the van right we're good with the run yeah okay cool cool great uh should i go back to the left i'm on a driving test i'm not trying to go fast just trying to drive safely i don't want to get undertaken so i'm moving back to the left keeping it safe not trying to show off anymore because i've nearly messed that one up uh oxbridge road i've heard of this or maybe i've heard an arc signal nice smooth into the right lane the traffic lights turn left okay cool got it we're not gonna move back yet because there's parked cars and stuff but after this red one i'm going to signal nice and early so everyone knows what i'm doing they've got loads of notice off the signal,495.52,554.0,875,195,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=495,
and then on approach i'm going to signal again boom nice and smooth how much gap should i leave to the car in front do you say tires on tarmac is that what you say to people yeah tires on tarmac or an imaginary car in between you both not like a really big car maybe an imaginary smart car put an imaginary smart car in between you and the kind front and then we're good i normally just say make sure you can see their back bumper and a bit of their tires yeah good okay it's funny how we've blatantly been taught to teach from completely different people but we've come up with the same slogans police car it's fine i'm with amman she's definitely got a license insurance so i'm okay to be a learner today uh okay i know do you have the problem in this mercedes where it scrapes over bumps and stuff not really no no unless you hit not unless you um kind of approach it too fast okay,555.44,606.16,884,190,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=555,
so maybe my students are just approaching bumps too fast maybe when you drive my car you'll realize are there any speed bumps around here yeah you can get to them i usually teach around here the green and there's so many speed bumps the square ones the long fat ones i hate the square ones the square ones are the worst did you know with the long ones they kind of used to call them a sleeping policeman oh i've heard that yeah yeah yeah because they slow you down like a policeman but those are those are the worst kind that kind of pronounced okay i know it's a 20 mile an hour limit so i'm just going to chill here i'm not going to go too mental i'm going to keep it in second gear as well because then i can hear the engine right yeah the engine sounds like it wants me to go to third gear when i go above 20. feel it's easier to control the speed in seconds then definitely do it yeah we're not,608.16,649.839,899,194,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=608,
trying to do eco driving on a driving test take the next road on your right please okay cool plus it's your instructor's pet right away sorry mirror signal some people say mirror signal maneuver some people say mirror signal position speed look however you've been taught it's a really good idea if you want a driving test to bring it back to basics especially if you're nervous just bring it right back to basics so that you don't forget anything yeah so the maneuver part is what's split into psr that's it yeah the most people just remember it as mirror signal maneuver it's kind of more the old school where your parents would probably say mirror signal maneuver but if your instructor is teaching you now you might hear a mirror signal and then adjust your position speed and look car behind he's going to pressure me now to go a bit faster but i know the speed limit is 20. so i'm going to chill here is it for 20 why is your say 30 that's,651.519,702.8,945,196,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=651,
not right is it it's definitely not right i should have been concentrating not talking shouldn't i if you can pull over and park up on the left hand side somewhere okay cool is that to let the car behind past the right signal again i'm not gonna rush this or try and get super duper close to the cab because i know that you can be a drain width away let's see if i can work this handbrake there you go cool sorry about the uh parking sensor thingy coming up on the screen what's that the front left parking lot i went to try to get changed this morning but yeah okay i'm gonna cut that bit out because of that thing coming up on your screen cutting out the bits where you say something stupid but not the bits where i say something stupid cheers listen and when i do my mock test i'm sitting there in silence talking chat however they like i'm in my examiner mode okay cool so yeah you ready to go again i am ready,704.56,759.68,914,195,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=704,
to go again i might get my phone out and just check what speed limit is on this road um no no no because an examiner wouldn't tell me i'm gonna work it out i'm gonna look for oh it doesn't come off by itself when you do that it doesn't you have to okay two things better on my car there's not a lot of things better on my car but there's two small ones you've got here with this right hold yeah yeah you can put that on you got hold okay yeah and that comes off with the gas okay cool so i'm take i took a second recheck that blind spot cool and crack on so what i'm looking for now put a little tally on inside what's better in this car in the other car uh what i'm looking for is are there any signs because 30 miles an hour is the urban speed limit i'm going to take this super slow this is not my car i would definitely go through this,761.76,808.72,839,193,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=761,
that's scary why does it do that since it's on the bunker yeah right dude mine doesn't do that tickle tick for my car it's not scaring the hell out of me where am i going just taking the second exit second exit it's on the left so i'm definitely not going to put a signal on now that would be well confusing and i'm going to signal once i pass the exit now um oh yeah speed limit so the best way to decide whether it's 20 or 30 if it's 30 which is the urban speed limit they don't repeat the signs at all if it's 20 you're going to get repeater signs everywhere can't see any repeat signs do you want us to take another guess at the speed limit anywhere someone might say it's 30 actually because no repeat of signs any piece nope not even in the side road to remind me to go 20. so i'm gonna say this is very so yeah i wouldn't probably go 30 down,810.959,858.639,848,203,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=810,
this way because look i can't see the pavements it's quite narrow as well it's not like a major at the end term right big roads i'm gonna 21 it's cool just so i can tip over to show i've seen it's 30 but not actually get marked down if it's actually 20. it's actually how to pass and flick your driving test tips with foxes uh i could have gone then and i'm gonna take it after the silver car so i'm getting myself ready even before the silver cars passed bringing the clutch up to by applying a little bit of gas okay cool this is obviously let's go let's roll over take check the mirror how often do you see people forget to do the mirrors when they're on the driving test is super nervous um most most times i notice they actually do check their mirrors quite regularly oh yeah i've never really had that even on what test even on hot spots um being an issue what's the biggest issue that you do,860.8,919.04,898,200,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=860,
have with students on a mock test the biggest reason they felt overthinking something that they've done back there and then making a serious mistake here okay yeah turn left at the very end please at the end turn left so no signal i might have signaled a little bit earlier than i did all the other junctions there but it's not confusing is it because there's nowhere else to turn and you definitely wouldn't be parking here no the signal timing's fine keeping a nice safe distance from the car in front and can i go alongside them here's something that you get a lot is it two lanes can you go alongside them it's not too late oh yeah you would devise that okay cool it's quite a wide corner here let's go so i'm just turning the fans on because it's starting to mess up a little bit that's me sweating there you go for it nice okay doing 31. have you got telemetry are they going to see the speed here no let's just bring,920.32,986.639,923,196,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=920,
it back down to 30 31 it's not the speed limit it's only one mile an hour it doesn't sound really bad does it but actually it's not the speed limit is it an examiner would definitely be noticing oh he keeps tipping everything it goes a little over and you step off the accelerator straight away then they wouldn't bother marking it down but it's just if you're continuously 3132 yeah for a little while then mark it down as a miner yeah for sure and then if you excessively go over then obviously straight away it's going to be a fail yeah okay roundabout's coming up i'm planning ahead way far in advance we go straight yeah so amman you didn't tell me anything there because we're going straight and examiner wouldn't tell you to go straight would they no they would expect you to know and work it out but if you're not sure ask an examiner would always help you with directions if you ask for,988.56,1035.679,895,190,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=988,
it in good time if you ask when you're already in position to take a certain exit they wouldn't necessarily tell you the time like it's this one hurry up they'll just say do what's safe okay and you've kind of just got to follow wherever your lane allows you to take the exit already okay i think we're going straight again so we're going to position left checking out the right that dhl vans not coming so i'm going to go don't forget your signal even though it's a little roundabout it's definitely not a mini roundabout so i've got a signal off it how would i know if it was a mini roundabout well the island in the middle would not just be a roundabout painted as opposed to raised bricks sure yeah i was going around something physical there was a bit of actual concrete and stuff in the middle but also the sign like the blue circle with the white hours as opposed to the other one here that's designed for a mini roundabout it's not on all,1036.839,1085.039,946,203,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=1036,
roundabouts just mini ones so i didn't see that so i'm remembering to signal i'm not clocking up my numbers left m4 you are definitely giving me the hardest route here so far this route has been okay it's not been too difficult i mean apart from that big roundabout but we're not going to talk about that let's go it's basically been wide long roads mainly dual carriageways if you go to another kind of test center like hit the green race all back streets wide roads but really fast and loads of traffic on them haven't got stuck in traffic yet is there not usually traffic down there not too much no it depends on the timing at the traffic lights turn right please okay the traffic lights at the junction ahead aren't actually working francis notices this but notices very late then i can have starbucks when people do a test brilliant do you know what we've got here the green to do well people are interested wow the lights are out oh,1086.24,1149.44,938,195,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=1086,
who's got priority when there's no traffic light the road marking at this junction suggests to do a near side turn but francis goes against this not me so i'm gonna be super duper safe and make sure that i'm not getting any anyone's way i'm not in a rush i'm on a driving test right yeah so i don't need to be aggressive go for it with the junction back there did you notice that the road marking actually suggested near did it no didn't notice that didn't notice that but i'll watch it back to the video in the video when we uh when you upload it to youtube and i'll be like whoopsie daisy so yeah great did i disobey road marking then yeah but it was more so because the guy in front he kind of looked like he wanted to go forward but then you've pushed forward so he's then done the same oh thanks yeah let's go with that it wasn't my fault was the guy in front,1151.12,1197.36,864,196,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=1151,
but you considering that the lights weren't working you should have looked at the road marking should have done i should have even if someone else does it the wrong way you don't necessarily want to copy them you should have kind of waited allowed him to turn traffic lights make a right turn click that's cool oh dear sounds like a man's directing me back to the test center for disappearing road marking it's been a hot hot summer just thought i'd warn you before then i guess because it's been windows open and stuff right yeah yeah yeah so when you go for your driving test now even if it's raining like cats and dogs they make you have the windows open yeah so you've got to dress appropriately for the weather conditions and don't yap to your examiner about what's going on because you're gonna disobey road markings uh that's a big ass lorry okay now follow signs to the west straight and from here please straighten cool so this is my independent driving independent driving is not a problem,1199.28,1262.88,999,199,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=1199,
means that the examiner is going to stop talking and i can stop being pressured let's go left at the mini roundabout absolutely but i have to signal because it's a left hand i'm not going to stop on a pedestrian crossing so i'm going to wait for them to move on checking out my right and let me go off here it's getting a little bit more residential not much harder because the road's still really wide i think if i drove here on my driving test i'd feel pretty relaxed because there's not a lot of hazards my face says no okay so less space less speed did you say that yeah yeah less space less space i say the smaller the gap the slower you go oh that's nice kind of sounds rhyming and poetic nice and easy to remember yeah really nice and then in terms of um clearance and spatial awareness i kind of just say as you're driving half a meter to the slides two car lengths in front and behind,1264.24,1326.4,893,190,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=1264,
creating like this safety bubble yes and then if you feel like your space is being invaded whether it's a parked car or an obstruction in front it's that slower the smaller the gap the slower you go yeah so potentially shrink it down stretch it out in front and behind could have slowed down for that tight situation back there and 40 miles an hour i waited there everyone else was off from the beginning of the road but i couldn't go off until i was past the sideline we're going to now follow signs towards oxbridge oxbridge yeah all of the funny names around here yeah oxbridge look at this a really long straight break how can you mess this up this is a piece of cake the amount of people that used to mess up along this road because it's doing what previously they've changed the speed limit now but um it used to be 30 and then it would suddenly go up to 60 at this point 60 on the side oh right but then if you,1327.679,1382.0,917,194,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=1327,
look along the road there are four so they still do 60 because that's what they used to practicing with and they're not yeah looking at the size whenever the speed limit has changed even if the sat nav reached 30 or 40 which is what you were kind of thinking about before yeah if the roads got like a 40 sign or a 20 sign that's what you're going with look at the confusion on this side what i've never seen anything like it why is that oxbridge is signposted as a fourth exit on this roundabout there are two ways to go towards uxbridge you can go through the roundabout onto the dual carriageway or you can go around the roundabout as the fourth exit so i think that's right probably third or fourth exit okay so that's the bit that gets people right and then you can ask your examiner is it right third or fourth exit yeah okay cool and they'll always tell you because they want you to go the right,1384.4,1430.4,901,198,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=1384,
way because if you get lost then it takes longer to get back for their cup of tea was it that way no do whatever is safe okay it was wasn't it it didn't look like it on this line until it looked like right fourth exit that's not a roundabout what the hell is that um sorry how do i get to oxford left i don't want to get lost and that was super safe sorry but when we were going around i didn't want to say suddenly that you need to jump over by three lanes i kind of just said do what's safe do you want safe and end up on the m4 what would happen if you ended up on the m4 and you're driving by the way they'll kind of direct you just say okay no not this way just to come off here and they'll go up to the other exit instead all right so that was the tricky that was the hardest junction that i've ever seen on a driving test that's so confusing you're not going to pass that,1432.0,1488.4,878,203,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=1432,
unless you've done that before with a driving instructor 100 a driving instructor can i tell you the truth you failed a long time say what i'm surprised at that not indeed but with the oxbridge bit how would you do that how would you work that out if you've never seen it before looking at that roundabout it kind of looked like oxford was generally towards the right yeah there were two ways of going backwards okay that's the way i win one was go round and then go through the middle and there was a massive sign in front there was i saw that at the last minute yeah really late and then the other one would have been as you go around instead of going on the far right move back to the left and take it like a normal roundabout yeah yeah which i didn't do either but i did check all my mirrors and there was nothing around so i moved left and right just super safe the way you kind of moved over if somebody does that on a test,1490.08,1548.4,929,196,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=1490,
the examiner's gonna be like this guy's a little very uncomfortable with that this guy's amazing at driving just take his license straight away okay cool so even if you think that you failed your driving test you're gonna carry on and you're gonna forget about the mistake that you've made and you're going to keep focused on what's ahead because what you think is a mistake a serious mistake the examiner might just think is a minor can i answer that question yeah what do you think of your following distance right now um thinking about overtaking because it's 50 here okay about the following distance two seconds one two three maybe i was a bit closer okay so the best way to monitor your following distance is when the lorry in front passes a landmark so like um that sign coming up or the start of this bridge you say only a fall breaks a two-second rule okay and if you pass it sooner than that then you are too close yes for sure and i did test it out before i,1550.24,1608.88,968,197,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=1550,
mentioned did you how how far did you get through the sentence it was near the end but it was it wasn't comfortable considering that you've got a lorry in front yeah and you're that close you can't see what's ahead of that lorry now we're no longer following signs that aren't spiritual i'm just going to give you directions as normal from now on yeah yeah sure okay ready for it so we're just going ahead from here okay over there is another scientific yeah but we're no longer following you sure just because it's gonna come off from the way we're actually going round about coming up slow down uh second exit do you say oh okay no sorry with this one okay 30 miles an hour right at this next round about just trying to mention that last round about you sort of straight line with that blue car on your right was going right i didn't i wasn't concentrating at all go for a right turn here we're going to hold that thought yeah just hold that thought,1611.12,1668.0,951,200,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=1611,
just do this right turn first because i feel like you're gonna super concentrate on this that's kind of the reason why you've made all the mistakes that you have so what you've just done there is what a typical student would do here not here okay on the last one yeah yeah as soon as you entered you thought oh i'm supposed to be going right yes because it is a weird funny angle yeah so you should have just stuck to the outskirts of that round for sure yeah they definitely down for that on the driving test don't do that this is where i'm going to say we're going to cut the tape and we're going to start again because if i was concentrating do the left turn just for that road okay cool it takes so much concentration to drive properly to drive room to drive to driving test standards so this is why when you're super duper nervous all you're thinking about is the nerves on your driving test and you're not focused on what's next planning ahead,1669.039,1718.159,949,197,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=1669,
how am i going to deal with it you will fail unless you can plan ahead a hundred well you've always i think what i always do is i would say um kind of take each road as it comes yeah and do an ongoing talk through yeah definitely a lot of the mistakes that you've made in this mock test because you're just talking and then you're not actually planning where you're going and then you end up missing the road signs or not realizing that your exit is coming up so an ongoing talk through jesus all right pin i am wounded now sorry come on no the ongoing talk through is really good because it kind of keeps you alert yeah so for example there's a bend towards the left it's part vehicles on the right so if someone was approaching we may have to give way because they would already have been committed in the bend okay and now you've got a ben going towards the right but no part vehicles oh parked vehicles on the right and a vehicle approaching,1720.88,1771.2,945,194,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=1720,
so you're already preparing for what could be approaching yeah that mental talk for a lot of people feel silly doing it though there's no harm in it out loud to the examiner how useful is it though to say what you're thinking so that they know what you're about to do hmm that's great oh this is a blind one so i'm slowing right down i've made a good effort to go around the mini roundabout as well not just shortcut it i'm going to make the same mistake twice obviously oh what the hell is this interesting branch of a tree or something okay yeah so if i was on the driving test and taking it super duper seriously i'd be saying zebra crossing can see a lady waiting check my mirrors slow down then what am i doing after so i'm gonna need to go back into first gear i'm gonna need to check check for any motorbikes or cyclists clutch gas go i feel like that's always been really helpful with a lot of my pupils in the,1772.72,1828.88,918,199,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=1772,
past where um they struggle and they feel a little bit overwhelmed with the number of things going on yeah that when they do this ongoing talk through whether it's out loud or just in your head it keeps you alert definitely 100 and you can concentrate much more on what's happening instead of the sorry icon from here so it's like a left then a right the two roundabouts are immediate one after the other should i concentrate on this and shut up please do whatever you like in terms of talking you can carry on it's up to you just stay focused on stay focused on the roundabout take us the right way have you been the wrong way yet no we i managed to get us back on oxford track with a sick move there can you tell i love driving so good especially someone else's car it can only rise lip that's this one that signal to let everyone know you know between the two roundabouts you kind of checked over your shoulder then yeah because there was a blind spot how,1830.72,1886.399,958,197,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=1830,
could we have done that a little bit more easily um what do you mean what if you know when you did that left hand instead of doing a sharp lift you could have done a wide left and turn straight into the right hand lane oh okay just had to look in the mirror that's it because that's what you would kind of expect a student to do you won't accept them to check their mirror suddenly in that round but would you i might do because if you're not sure yeah if you're not sure there's something in the in the mirror traffic lights we're going to be turning right right okay if you're not sure that the mirror is giving you enough information then you definitely want to know yeah what's around you i just felt like i wasn't sure whether there was a motorbike coming around that first roundabout so definitely don't want to crash a car am i unsure this traffic light junction can be quite tricky sometimes the traffic kind of from opposite,1888.399,1937.919,933,192,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=1888,
with a little service road they start at the same time okay so sometimes when you go into the middle you have to sit in the middle of the crossroads at a weird position where you're not expecting to wait really on the next one the one we just did you were right because nobody was in front of you i'm going to do mirrors first because what if there's a cyclist or motorbike coming around as you're waiting it's just you want to just keep alert surroundings because cyclists would catch up motorbikes would catch up check gas go do you tell people not to stay at the brighton point then traffic oh i hate that do you really why well firstly even if you lift the clutch a little bit in this client auto ribs okay so there's what's the point of water revving it a red light yeah yeah fuel where's the biting point so they would wait with the clutch completely down or out of gear and out of gear okay yeah why i'll get because you've got another,1939.44,1988.24,942,199,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=1939,
thing to do to get when the lights on how long does it really take to put the clutch down and select one for new drivers obviously i wouldn't need to do that but for somebody who's experienced drivers do that all the time anyways okay so red lights yeah clutch down all right and then now clutch up clutch and change yeah if you're the first car you can wait in gear the whole time but like generally i choose to be in neutral myself okay yeah i do that too because then the engine turns off right does your car do that yeah and then it stays all right take the next road on your left please okay cool next ride on the left yes that's quite a way down what i'm looking for honest not there is gaps in houses gaps in park cars gaps in the road and pavement that was in fourth year i looked down and hit it like second sorry go left left okay mirror signal second gear as long as you control the the speed before the entry there that's,1989.6,2051.04,933,194,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=1989,
fine so that gear change was quite late the first one yeah definitely managed to control it still do you know how i could tell because the car was rumbling it wasn't comfortable at the speed that i was doing i could feel it starting to grumble so i was definitely sure that that was not so 20 miles per hour is the minimum that you can that you can do in fourth gear and that's where it starts to rumble a little bit okay yeah these bumps are pretty harsh but your suspension's quite firm i'm going over it nicely look at this that's pretty fast my car would be wait did you drive my car you're gonna be like what is this never upgrading to a brand new mercedes suspension feels like it's out of a cornflake box straight on here yeah yeah straight in from here [Music] it's almost like i'm sponsored by audi to say bad things about audi if you're ready i'm ready for the hookup i had an audi before this that's great,2052.8,2104.88,916,199,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=2052,
which one i had an a3 i asked literally my favorite card to teach him yeah why did you change this well i had that for four years and i wanted to get an upgrade so i was like what do i get you downgraded to an a class are you sponsored by mercedes is this gonna get beeped out the plus points on this is the uh i love the reversing camera oh yes yeah that tells you where your wheels are about to go yeah yeah so it makes maneuvers it's pretty easy yeah so you can see here on the inside you've got hatch markings and it's fairly faded out which is where people have been driving over them but you shouldn't do that unless you need to unleash you need to but going around with uh bends and stuff you'll generally see that they've worn out because people the back tire even goes over sometimes okay cool this is getting busier as well so what i'm thinking is my speed is reducing because,2106.88,2162.0,886,189,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=2106,
there's so much going on here she last minute i was the last name she didn't know she was crossing yeah i know but you gotta stay on top of it so if we think about the mistakes in this mock test today if this was a pupil yeah would you have i'd be looking for them to approach that slower maybe i'd be expecting them to probably assume that someone would cross rather than assume someone wouldn't cross because you'd rather stop at a crossing that someone doesn't cross that then go at a crossing that nobody goes out right exactly yeah for sure so you'd rather stop even if they look like they're gonna cross but then they don't there's no harm in that yeah definitely no harm in stopping you might get hesitation if you stop and there's no one there literally no one there yeah but if you stopped and she looked like she was gonna cross but then she doesn't and then you just check and move straight away yeah there's nothing,2163.599,2213.52,927,191,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=2163,
to it for sure it has to be a sufficient like amount of weight for it to be a hesitation fault so a brief stop there if she looks like she's got a cross isn't necessarily a fault basically what you're saying a man is he should have slowed down and stopped because she was closer can i give you a maneuver now so if you could see your park on the right hand side of the road all right sick let's go after this white one check and before that van gets to me i'm going to make sure that my wheels are stopped so that i'm not driving towards them on the wrong side of the road cool okay so whenever you're ready i'd like you to reverse back for about two car lengths keeping reasonably close to and parallel with the pavement as you carry out the exercise okay try not to touch the pavement so ammon's been very kind and given me the easiest maneuver that you can get on a driving test oh that's different okay interesting there's a reversing camera i'm pointing,2215.359,2268.079,958,200,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=2215,
at you guys can't see it so there is a car coming towards me but i'm going to start reversing anyway because they are going to take a few seconds to get to me and when they do i'm going to stop check before they pass that i can move again straight away not wasting time checking my mirror to check i'm still parallel with the cab and no more cars coming towards me so i can keep going that's roughly two car spaces your examiner will stop you after three or four car spaces so let's hold it there you were just going to let me keep going weren't you i was just thinking how long is he going to keep going really they'd say thanks that's cool but that's normally if um you're taking them to a little while and you've nearly completed your two and they'll be like oh thank you that's fine before let me just see how you were just going to be like let's see how long he can stay parallel with the curb flipping ice that,2269.68,2327.2,916,198,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=2269,
you guys can't see it but it's amazing all right so whenever you're ready let's drive off from here let's do it okay so i'm not going to bother to start signaling yet because i just can't go oh yeah i can that is a space check the blind spot and move i didn't get in anybody's way there so i was waiting for a nice clear gap before i signaled away from the curb because there's no point sitting there with a signal and confusing if you see a people approaching then obviously put your indicator on do you tracks and be on your way yeah if there's traffic passing you there's no point of you keeping that running if you don't intend to go straight away and here's an important one do your checks before they start take the road on the right sorry red on right do your checks before the last car passes that you're ready to set off straight away yeah don't wait for the car to pass then check then you've missed the gap,2329.119,2373.839,917,197,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=2329,
can i let these guys go so as you see the last vehicle sort of approaching start your checks yeah so as soon as they've passed you've completed your blind spot good to go and then you're off take the road on the right please okay actly road green away i love the road names around here in here the green we have road names like the green lane super super super uh original those are thought went into that didn't it going ahead from the traffic lights okay cool this is a pretty long driving test i'm now we're just coming back sorry i stretched it out a little bit you did just to find more things like that i wanted to go up to cherry roundabout you know the one that you hated oh yes that's what stretched it the oxbridge one did they actually do that on a test from here then um not anymore okay they used to do this that that roundabout in hayes but they moved sort of the test center to getting now to everybody,2376.72,2431.92,917,194,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=2376,
from that to here so they you can do that on a driving test if you take a driving test around here no not anymore not even from hayes no no because his haze is closed down okay so don't worry if you are taking a driving test around here won't hit that roundabout okay so we're going to follow the road ahead so that roundabout was basically a dual carriageway running through the round finally through a roundabout yeah i call that the roundabout because it's nice it did on the side yeah yeah yes let's go do a youtube video about how to drive a boat okay i saw that sign back there so i know i can't use the left lane to go straight does that help me plan ahead that was good this looks like a pretty busy one this is um a difficult roundabout especially from this direction because it's so busy okay so i'm just gonna wait for a blocker that's leaving oh wait a minute can i slip into that gap behind in front of,2433.839,2496.8,915,200,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=2433,
the bus no definitely not that's not enough room for a driving test you can see one white car on the outside they're still coming around there's not a lot of gap to go here where's that grey car going they are coming around as well i definitely wouldn't take that on a drive so you can see some of the vehicles next to you have been going but the gaps just haven't been right just because they're going doesn't mean you need to right so if i was on a driving test a real one with a driving license on the line i'd be getting kind of stressed now because i know that it's taking me a long time and i've seen loads of other cars there's my gap loads of other cars leaving yeah but if there's no gap to go you aren't hesitating so you can just chill and so that would be no hesitation whatsoever there you didn't have any minors nothing yes first time take the road on the right and we're just going to loop around,2498.8,2552.48,911,199,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=2498,
yeah okay cool to start where we oh yes back to starbucks i feel like i need to sit down in a stiff drink after this all right cool [Music] into the heavy goods vehicle testing station it's a really nice test center here massive car park and they've got good facilities for the learners here yeah they definitely do we're going to put it in park actually um you should go into the tesla now so you can see it no no no she gets hold off going straight on we're just gonna go past this roundabout and then pull in and park just there i've been told off at many a test center for messing about with filming so dvsa okay cool oh look there's examiners out in full force ready to issue people with driving licenses wow that was fun i enjoyed that a lot thanks all right for answers if you can secure the car and switch off the engine thank you mr weird handbook yeah that was great to top up my my results please i've,2553.28,2611.839,912,195,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=2553,
passed peace i've asked please have passed how do you think you did today i think i definitely passed if an examiner asked you how you think you did you've got to say you passed i think i failed for xyz reason oh i didn't say that see that no they would do they would have seen it yeah they definitely would have seen it now unfortunately that would be a fail really what something really quite early on what are you talking about a man i feel a bit hasty here and there so there's been a few chances but the main one the first one for me was that first round about where we turned right you started off in the right hand lane which was the overtaking of the two positions so you got left which was going right and then you've got the right going right as you're talking about the car on my left that i snuck in front off yeah so as you've gone round you've stayed on the right which is correct but then as you're passing second exit,2614.079,2656.88,933,198,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=2614,
there are three lanes on your left which are leaving and you're in the fourth one i was yeah yeah yeah and i realized and i was like i've got to get across and then you try to get across and as you're moving the guy behind was moving at the same time but he kind of got there before us but with that one a lot of students tend to do that because you're kind of checking your mirrors and moving at the same time but the other guy was kind of not expecting you to move in front of him he wasn't just giving him a couple of clicks of signal but it looked from his row position that he wasn't expecting that and he kind of stopped close behind us right yeah so what would you do if that was on your driving test you realize oh my god i'm in the fourth lane you should have just stayed in the fourth lane waited out there and go around waiting at that red light and then if it's now clear keep that,2658.88,2692.88,893,193,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=2658,
indicator running if it's now clear he passes you move in or just loop go around yeah go the wrong way or go all the way around the roundabout to make sure that you're not doing anything bad you couldn't do that and then the road marking on that traffic light right turn traffic i wouldn't say it's a serious exactly but you kind of didn't respect the road marking so clearly the traffic lights were out oh yes ah the traffic lights they were broken you kind of didn't notice until very late i did notice very late because i was talking to you guys you're welcome um so yeah there were road markers on the floor even after amman said i didn't realize that there were road markers on the floor i was looking at the traffic lights and scanning the traffic so intently because i know yeah you dealt with the junction generally very nicely because you kind of made sure it's clear and you dealt with the vehicle ahead of you well but he's intending to turn and he's kind of going,2695.28,2740.64,975,201,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=2695,
up forward and then you've zoomed forward and then he's going around behind you yeah now you can do that because now we can see the road ahead but the right ideal thing to do unless the road markings tell you to go otherwise so if somebody else is kind of doing it the wrong way just don't feel like you've got to copy what they're doing just do it safely do it safely even if you're in the wrong position deal with it safely so if what i did was safe but i disobeyed road marking would that still be the thing you know that traffic light junction yeah the one with the lights out when i was 19 i hadn't had a big accident on that track really yeah i am i went into that offside position which you did okay and there was a bus blocking my view yeah yeah yeah so now i'm sitting in the middle and then i couldn't see any anybody for a while so as i kind of wait you'd have edged,2742.88,2782.48,877,194,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=2742,
forward thinking oh is it clear and a big range rover came out no that must have been scary yeah yeah definitely so that's why i always when it comes to crossroads i'm always really strict about them sorry about that this should not have come through that's why you're being really strict with me and saying even though it was a super safe junction the lights were out yeah you're going to fail for disobeying road marking and that's perfectly fair an examiner would do exactly the same thing they'd be really impressed they'd have to say i was really impressed with how you dealt with that but regulations are this has got to happen you've got a bay road markings and on this occasion francis you failed your driving test and you know on youtube and you know the um that's been cherry roundabout uh yes the burger yes now i'm gonna say for that one i know you've never seen a junction like that so you should have taken that junction a little bit slower i've seen,2784.079,2832.64,964,198,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=2784,
the road marking just enjoying the rev of this how big is your engine yeah it's a 1.5 but it's oh bigger than mine but yeah that's what it is okay cool so happy with that so in terms of my advice for you for a mock test in the future stop talking stop talking take it seriously and slow down all right thank you for watching but yeah follow from tv driving school tv i've actually failed a mock test before so i haven't learned my lessons do you know what i felt for what was it for speeding watch the channel click subscribe and find that video of me failing at a mock test for speeding well i'm hoping to pass my mock test yeah let's swap now jump in my car and see if you can pass the mock test in on my channel yeah let's go all right brilliant,2834.72,2883.76,748,164,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=2834,
[Music] hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving today i'm doing another mock test and this is for mohammed now we've been driving for quite a while now we had um quite a few breaks actually now your test is in is it ten days eight days or so now this is our second mock test the first mock test he drove really well but made two serious faults but that was just with his maneuver which we were quite surprised about actually but at least you're now in light and then kind of know what's expected of the maneuvers there so that's good all right so um before we get started could you tell me uh about the general condition of your tyres to be roadworthy um there's there can't be any bulges or cuts or slashes in them okay and the tread depth has to be 1.6 millimeters all right sounds good so for the test today i'm not going to use,0.1,65.199,837,184,tcK-uNEhE7U,1803,https://youtu.be/tcK-uNEhE7U?t=0,
a sat nav i'm just going to give you instructions throughout so throughout the drive follow the road ahead whenever i need you to turn i will tell you if i don't say anything keep going straight if you're not sure where you're going you can always ask yeah okay and if you ever go the wrong way don't freak out just stay nice and calm so we're gonna do one maneuver and we may also do the emergency stop okay okay all right so when you're ready we're gonna get started hi guys and welcome back to another mock test with me now throughout this video there are various highlights of what you should be doing everything in green is what you should be doing on approach to junctions anything in amber is advisory or it could be a minor fault anything in red is serious or dangerous,66.799,118.079,777,158,tcK-uNEhE7U,1803,https://youtu.be/tcK-uNEhE7U?t=66,
and turn left just in here on approach to this left turn muhammad slows down and switches back into first gear for better control as he cannot see into the new road [Music] take the next road on your right please,137.76,168.48,212,44,tcK-uNEhE7U,1803,https://youtu.be/tcK-uNEhE7U?t=137,
okay muhammad if you could just pull in and park on the left before the grey car don't worry about the drives on this one okay [Music] thank you [Music] okay so what i'd like you to do now using the vehicle in front i'd like you to demonstrate how you would carry out the parallel park exercise okay so start alongside the vehicle in the road then reverse back and finish within two columns and try not to touch the pavement as you do this,195.2,228.48,439,94,tcK-uNEhE7U,1803,https://youtu.be/tcK-uNEhE7U?t=195,
before starting to reverse always do an all-round check making sure that you thoroughly look over both right and left blind spot the right blind spot check is vital at this point as you start to steer left the front of your vehicle will start to swing into the road so you need to always check over your right blind spot whilst you're reversing muhammad uses really slow clutch control which gives him more time to be able to look around while reversing and also enough time to be able to steer into this space so that he can park very easily,249.12,281.44,542,105,tcK-uNEhE7U,1803,https://youtu.be/tcK-uNEhE7U?t=249,

after the last part vehicle on the left muhammad moved back towards the left hand side making sure that he leaves the vehicle enough clearance [Music] at the end turn right coming up to this t-junction after the white van passes muhammad moves back towards the left hand side of the road to make sure he's not over the center line at the t junction as we got to the t junction there was nobody approaching from the right hand side so muhammad starts to slowly go forward going up onto the cycle lane making sure both sides of the road are clear before emerging completely when it's safe to do so i'd like you to demonstrate how you switch on the ready mister [Music] thank you following behind a larger vehicle always leave enough space in front in case you need to move around them you've got enough space to do so whenever you're behind a large bus always be wary that the bus may stop occasionally at bus stops along the left hand side,319.759,407.44,938,191,tcK-uNEhE7U,1803,https://youtu.be/tcK-uNEhE7U?t=319,
at the roundabout turn left that's the first exit on approach to this roundabout to make a left turn muhammad positions round into the left hand side of the road going up to the giveaway line in a good position whilst in this position you should be looking all around not just towards the right hand side sometimes pedestrians may step out the road in front of you now this isn't a fault but it's a good idea to look ahead as well as the right hand side on approach to the bus at the bus stop ahead muhammad uses his mirrors and signals to overtake the bus as we're approaching the bus driver does change his signal to start moving into the road at this point we should have given way as it was safe to do so mohammed continues and the vehicle behind us also carries on and overtakes the bus now this wouldn't go down as a serious fault but it would go down as a minor fault,414.08,481.12,874,184,tcK-uNEhE7U,1803,https://youtu.be/tcK-uNEhE7U?t=414,
the approach to this pedestrian crossing is very good we've got a really smooth break on approach to the stop as the pedestrian makes their way into the middle of the crossing mohammed selects first gear scanning both sides of the crossing before continuing okay when we get to the next roundabout i'd like you to take the fourth exit going towards northampton [Music] so [Music] as you move into a roundabout it's always a good idea to check the mirrors towards the left as you enter in case of vehicles from the left that may straight line the roundabout just like this fan did [Music],499.36,577.91,587,121,tcK-uNEhE7U,1803,https://youtu.be/tcK-uNEhE7U?t=499,
as we came off this roundabout muhammad shows good awareness and planning as he notices the bus ahead in advance and uses his mirrors and signals to overtake in good time [Music] as soon as we get past the bus he uses his mirror's signals back and moves back into the left-hand lane which is the position for normal driving,604.16,623.279,323,67,tcK-uNEhE7U,1803,https://youtu.be/tcK-uNEhE7U?t=604,
[Music] and then turn left at the very end here [Music] as there are part vehicles all along the left hand side of this road we do not have priority mohammed deals with the oncoming van really well by slowing down and positioning in the middle of the road to give the van enough space to get through if needed you can give way on the left hand side of the road you can pull in and park up on the left place whenever you're trying to pull over and park on the left always try and park within about a drains width from the pavement and try and avoid driveways when parking up okay so we're gonna start the independent part of the driving test now okay so i'd like you to go up to the very end of this road turn right and then right again and then i'm gonna get you to follow some signs from there okay okay [Music] sorry the end of this rodeo [Music],653.94,762.2,848,187,tcK-uNEhE7U,1803,https://youtu.be/tcK-uNEhE7U?t=653,

as we're waiting at this t-junction to make this right turn the new road that we're moving on to is a 40 miles per hour road as the road's fairly busy we had to wait a little while before we could join the vehicles on the left hand side were starting to queue and we couldn't see very well towards the left hand side of the road there was a vehicle approaching as we moved out but they were approaching at a distance but at speed so this would have gone down as a minor for observation once we're on the new road mohammed makes good progress with the speed of the road as it's a 40 miles per hour road if it's safe to do so drive up to the speed of the road okay i'd like you to follow signs of central london now for a little while,792.8,843.519,732,164,tcK-uNEhE7U,1803,https://youtu.be/tcK-uNEhE7U?t=792,
when following behind a vehicle when driving above 30 miles per hour always make sure to leave at least two seconds of gap in front now mohammed has to keep on breaking at this point because he's following the van too closely,858.639,868.88,225,46,tcK-uNEhE7U,1803,https://youtu.be/tcK-uNEhE7U?t=858,
when going round a roundabout if your right indicator turns off remember to reapply if you have time as muhammad sees the second exit ahead he starts using his mirrors and spiraling towards the left-hand lane to take the exit but he should have put a left indicator on to make it clear that he's leaving along this 50 miles per hour slip road mohammed makes really good progress to get up to the speed before joining the dual carriageway as we're joining you can see there's a lot of congestion and the traffic in front is actually a little bit slower he should have tried to adjust his speed before joining we're no longer following any signs from here okay as we're driving along the carriageway you can see that everybody from the first lane is trying to move into the second lane and you can see the traffic in the second and third lane seems to be moving a lot slower than the first lane with how the traffic is flowing at the,915.12,973.199,931,194,tcK-uNEhE7U,1803,https://youtu.be/tcK-uNEhE7U?t=915,
moment you can tell that there must be an obstruction in the left hand lane which is causing everybody to move into the middle lane no more signs i'll tell you whenever i need you to turn okay we're just going to come off at north so we don't need to move anywhere as we're going forward you can now see that there's an obstruction in the left hand lane in the distance ahead as we're going forward mohammed should have started signaling and waiting for the middle lane to give way before moving over even at the point that mohammed does notice the hazard he starts using his mirrors and signaling but he's not adjusting his speed at this point he could have stopped behind the red car but gets too close and pushes towards the right [Music] he causes the vehicle in the middle lane to have to slow down and stop suddenly as he hasn't given them enough notice that he needs to move over if needed he should have stopped in the left-hand lane before the red car,974.56,1039.039,960,197,tcK-uNEhE7U,1803,https://youtu.be/tcK-uNEhE7U?t=974,

yeah i was like i'm so i thought i broke a bit like i knew it was late but i thought okay think about did you realize on that carriageway there was a lot of traffic in the distance yeah you should be thinking wait why is there traffic all of a sudden why is my lane moving faster than everyone else's yeah so you left it very late to move over there okay okay that's where the issue came in yeah yeah um you're signaling and you're kind of expecting them to give way we had that silver car and i was actually about to break at that point yeah the lady behind with the black car she gave you way but like you're not really giving them enough time you're kind of going just up to the car and you're about to move over if it wasn't for that i realized that's it yeah did you notice that there was something that everybody in your lane was moving out for quite a little honor i only only clocked,1456.799,1502.88,891,194,tcK-uNEhE7U,1803,https://youtu.be/tcK-uNEhE7U?t=1456,
till i saw the actual car oh okay yeah i know you could see it quite early on that there was a man standing on the pavement everybody from the left lane was moving over in the distance and that's kind of the reason why your lane was moving so fast in comparison because everybody from your lane was moving over yeah okay yeah do you understand why that's a serious fault yeah besides that there's lots of good things i want to talk about your parallel park brilliant really nice observation really good control you parked in a really nice spot and that was great emergency stop very good stop yeah and even the look looking around great there's a few things i want to go over in terms of miners [Music] early on the first miner that you got was for overtaking that bus the 120 i think it was you didn't need to overtake the bus as you've come up behind the bus the bus was in fact trying to move off yeah i thought it might take a bit,1504.72,1557.2,934,195,tcK-uNEhE7U,1803,https://youtu.be/tcK-uNEhE7U?t=1504,
i don't know it depends you're supposed to give way to the bus right yeah so if he's already indicating right you should have just waited for him now because you've got you've managed to get round and the bus driver didn't actually start moving off there it was kind of all right got away with the miner and even the lady behind she's come through yeah but we should have been giving way to the bus on two separate occasions when leaving roundabouts you're not indicating left you know when you're coming off from doing a right turn or oh at the end yeah oh yeah yeah there were two indicators missing on that one one was um cutting the corner nearly at the end here you know that right turn you did before the emergency stop yeah that was nearly a serious that was the only other potential serious so i asked you to turn right and the road we're going into have parked cars on both sides yeah and you couldn't really see into the road right okay yeah,1558.4,1612.96,951,194,tcK-uNEhE7U,1803,https://youtu.be/tcK-uNEhE7U?t=1558,
but you still kind of just cut the corner so you turned across the wrong side and you're kind of going into the middle and you couldn't see into the road okay what if a car was coming yeah yeah um and lastly you know when we went on to that dual carriageway before that serious mistake actually happened yeah as you're driving down there i felt like you kept trying to get up to 50 and you could see there was a lot of traffic yeah but you're still trying to go fast so only drive up to that speed if it's safe if everyone else is a bit slower just you should have been leaving a bit more space in front of you and that's kind of the reason why that happened because you were so quick to try to get up to that speed you didn't notice so how do you think we could have dealt with that issue for next time yeah so awareness and planning how would you have sorted out that issue with the ferrari like i'll probably look ahead further and i think something must,1615.36,1666.96,957,206,tcK-uNEhE7U,1803,https://youtu.be/tcK-uNEhE7U?t=1615,
like just more and more me be more proactive yeah being a bit more aware of what's going on in front trying to figure out why everybody was moving over yeah and then as soon as you saw the man standing or the red car wasn't moving start checking but adjusting your speed for the right i have a question yes even if i realized late but i um i broke i broke a bit earlier and just yeah had you had you noticed a bit late and kind of just stopped and not tried to move over like that it still would have been okay and then when they give you weights okay but be better yeah you should be planning a little bit more okay and just one more last thing when you were driving behind that large van when we were following signs of central london yeah you should have kept a bigger distance you're trying to drive up to 40 and he's kind of driving 35 but you you're within your distance but it's just you've got a,1669.279,1720.08,903,191,tcK-uNEhE7U,1803,https://youtu.be/tcK-uNEhE7U?t=1669,
large van and you can't see ahead of him okay okay so only drive up to the speed of the road if it's safe but overall really good especially on all the roundabouts i had no issues on the roundabouts yeah yeah so well done for that but it's okay something for you to bear in mind because you you didn't notice it's not even nice like now that i've been in that kind of situation i think i'd be fine yeah definitely uh there was one more bit where you rolled back when we got to the end of that road and you stopped and then you looked and i think there was like a blue car coming from the right and you looked both ways after that car when you tried to move you kind of rolled back a little bit i thought i could have i remember i remember that i thought i could have gone before the blue car it was all right that you waited it was okay don't over think yeah little gaps yeah but at that point i looked behind and because you're rolling back the guy,1721.919,1770.559,949,205,tcK-uNEhE7U,1803,https://youtu.be/tcK-uNEhE7U?t=1721,
behind was just about to use the horn but then you managed to get the break in time yeah i remember that i remember that i rolled back a bit so try and control that a little bit quicker okay okay all right well done overall though but thank you for watching i hope that video was useful and as you can see even though he was driving really well still made that one fault where he didn't see what was going on ahead but yeah just needed to deal with it slightly earlier and safer but at least you know for next time yes yes thank you for watching,1771.52,1799.679,545,112,tcK-uNEhE7U,1803,https://youtu.be/tcK-uNEhE7U?t=1771,

hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving today i'm doing another mock test with assam now he's got his test in nearly just under three minutes just under three weeks now we've done a lot of work on um roundabouts and everything that stuff that he kind of didn't really know how to deal with in the past but he's doing a lot better so we're gonna do a mock test today to see how he's improved yeah okay if you haven't seen his last mock test i'll list it down on the page at this point um it's worth the watch okay um all right so whenever you're ready we're gonna get started before we get started i'm just gonna ask you a quick question could you tell me how do you check that the tires have the correct um condition to be roadworthy there should not be any cuts or scratches from the tires and it should be 1.6 millimeter okay great sounds good all right so whenever you're ready,15.04,64.479,886,195,Hj3ZsoKnPHI,1711,https://youtu.be/Hj3ZsoKnPHI?t=15,

driving down this road essan maintains a good distance from the bus which allows him to see more of the road ahead he notices the oncoming lorry indicating and he stops in good time making sure that he's not blocking the entrance of the road on the left,136.48,149.04,253,53,Hj3ZsoKnPHI,1711,https://youtu.be/Hj3ZsoKnPHI?t=136,

as we're driving along this road essang gets marked down for progress appropriate speed the speed of this road is 30 miles per hour but essan is driving at 20 miles per hour as there is a lot of traffic on the opposite side of the road and various hazards and pedestrians about it's not safe to drive up to 30 but he should have been driving up to about 25 miles per hour,233.84,254.159,371,82,Hj3ZsoKnPHI,1711,https://youtu.be/Hj3ZsoKnPHI?t=233,

when driving along on a road like this try and get up to the speed of the road if it's safe to do so but also maintain a good following distance from the vehicles ahead if there are two or more lanes you should always drive in the left hand lane unless you are overtaking or turning right if your right turn is not for a while you shouldn't move into the overtaking lane until your turn is close approaching okay so when it's safe to do so i'd like you to demonstrate how you would wash the front windscreen thank you [Music],701.68,744.13,525,112,Hj3ZsoKnPHI,1711,https://youtu.be/Hj3ZsoKnPHI?t=701,

[Music] okay if you can pull in and park up on the left hand side please anyway don't worry about the drives again on this occasion that's great there thank you okay so what i'd like you to do now using the vehicle in front is to demonstrate how you would carry out the parallel park exercise so start alongside the vehicle in the road then reverse back and finish within two car lengths and try not to touch the pavement as you do this okay so whenever you're ready,1226.29,1256.799,466,96,Hj3ZsoKnPHI,1711,https://youtu.be/Hj3ZsoKnPHI?t=1226,
before starting the reverse you want to check all around making sure to look over both blind spots and make sure nobody is around you whilst you start reversing if anyone turns up as you're reversing and they're passing quite close then you should stop and then look around again to make sure it's clear before you continue essan is an experienced driver but has a bit of a bad habit of using braking clutch rather than using clutch control when it comes to maneuvers now this isn't something that the examiner is going to mark you down for as long as the vehicle is moving slowly and you finish your maneuver within the required space thank you travis whenever you're ready,1288.24,1332.559,674,129,Hj3ZsoKnPHI,1711,https://youtu.be/Hj3ZsoKnPHI?t=1288,

approaching this t-junction to make a left turn esson goes up to the end of the road has a quick glance and enters straight away now this could have been an issue if somebody had been approaching from the right at speed it's best to always stop use first gear and look carefully before you enter driving down roads like this with parked vehicles on both sides you need to be wary of any vehicles that might be sticking out or any tyres that might be out of line or even a wing mirror that might be slightly further out as the road gets too narrow and you may need to stop that's the roundabout time right [Music],1404.72,1459.71,612,127,Hj3ZsoKnPHI,1711,https://youtu.be/Hj3ZsoKnPHI?t=1404,
okay if you can pull in and park up on the left just behind the red car again don't worry too much about the drives on this one that's great thank you thank you secure the car and just switch off the engine as well brilliant okay just give me a few minutes also okay how was the drive for you i think i failed you have no faith in yourself no when you put your hand up like that well she flashed her lights just because i put my hand up doesn't mean it's a mistake okay yeah that's why i didn't get the um book out to put my my notes in because i felt like as soon as i grabbed the book your attention is going to be on me [Music] now that would be a pass okay okay we've got a few minor mistakes but overall really good driving the roundabouts were great yeah okay all right so let me go over some of the mistakes i made another series then the last round last second last round,1510.24,1575.84,879,192,Hj3ZsoKnPHI,1711,https://youtu.be/Hj3ZsoKnPHI?t=1510,
i was just well not fast i think i've been like just on the giveaway lines so when the car was just going around the no no no you you were not behind you were not over the giveaway line at all it's because of the way the lady was doing a u-turn you know when you do a u-turn you kind of go left and then do it right she didn't do that yeah she went into it like a right turn she was close that's why i waited there no no i checked on this side when because i saw you probably got a bit nervous there but you know you were definitely behind the giveaway line so don't worry all right so some of the minor faults i just want to go over so firstly we have um progress there was a 30 road right at the very beginning before the lady flashed her headlights at you um it was a clear 30 road you're driving 20 the whole time but the reason it's a minor is because there's lots of,1578.88,1624.64,872,197,Hj3ZsoKnPHI,1711,https://youtu.be/Hj3ZsoKnPHI?t=1578,
pedestrians there's traffic on the other side you thought it was a 20. i thought it was really yeah that's the only reason that you got a miner there because we can't exactly drive at 30 on that road but you could have gone a little bit over so that's the only road you were a bit slow on then i always try to go over the speed limit this time another thing okay and then the next one was um where i put my hand up as a thank you to the lady in the um little smart car yeah awareness and planning so you knew you were going straight there there was cycling so that's why was the cycle in a solid line or a broken line okay are we allowed in broken lines i think so i'm not sure yeah provided you've checked and it's safe you can go over that section because the lane you needed to go into it's clear wasn't it yeah that's clear that's why everyone else was going and that's why,1626.0,1667.6,877,197,Hj3ZsoKnPHI,1711,https://youtu.be/Hj3ZsoKnPHI?t=1626,
when i saw everyone else was going to try to change the lane yeah the lady came in so i didn't cut in no no you didn't cut you signaled you were checking and then she flashed her headlights to give you weight and then you moved over if you had moved over and slowed them down that would have been different so overall that was a very good drive okay we have got three miners but nothing majorly to be concerned about but overall i'm happy with that thank you you're happy with that thanks yeah well done okay one second for anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like comment and subscribe um if you'd like to learn how to drive i post videos on driving lessons and mock tests thank you for watching [Music],1669.279,1710.21,717,149,Hj3ZsoKnPHI,1711,https://youtu.be/Hj3ZsoKnPHI?t=1669,

hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving today i'm doing a mock test with martha now her test is coming up in just under two weeks time this is her first official mock test yep yes so we've been doing a lot of work on meeting situations and maneuvers because that's some of her weak areas so we've kind of got a route that will hopefully be a bit challenging and um if there's any errors we can then correct them we've got enough time before the test okay now throughout the drive i want you to follow the road ahead whenever i need you to turn i will tell you if i don't say anything keep going straight i am going to just get you to follow the sat nav for this one just so you get used to the instruction on there we're going to do one maneuver and we may also carry out the emergency stop all right so whenever you're ready let's begin and the sat nav will start to kind of tell you what you're doing all right,22.96,73.04,918,198,VHmRRX3bLpc,1660,https://youtu.be/VHmRRX3bLpc?t=22,

go left on the roundabout and take the first exit the vehicle approaching from the right hand side is turning left so we can enter the roundabout straight away on approach to the large van parked up martha moves towards the middle of the road which allows for enough clearance from the van but it also makes it easier to see the road ahead more clearly,176.0,204.0,352,69,VHmRRX3bLpc,1660,https://youtu.be/VHmRRX3bLpc?t=176,

okay well it's safe to do so i'd like you to demonstrate how you would wash the front windscreen [Music] okay thank you driving in the city it's always harder to deal with larger vehicles due to the size of the roads and the number of part vehicles martha notices the oncoming bus in good time and so she's able to stop which allows her enough time to be able to get through without needing to squeeze next to the bus [Music],306.88,341.4,425,93,VHmRRX3bLpc,1660,https://youtu.be/VHmRRX3bLpc?t=306,
go right on the roundabout and take the second exit [Music] when looking for a safe gap to enter at a mini roundabout it's important to look all around as sometimes vehicles from the left may block the vehicles from the right from entering and you can use this as a gap [Music] cross the roundabout and take the second exit [Music],360.72,406.62,331,72,VHmRRX3bLpc,1660,https://youtu.be/VHmRRX3bLpc?t=360,

cross the roundabout and take the second exit with meeting traffic in narrow roads always try and allow at least two car lengths ahead to be able to easily get around the park vehicle without getting too close always remember the smaller the gap the slower you go and then lower the gear as well,446.16,473.759,295,56,VHmRRX3bLpc,1660,https://youtu.be/VHmRRX3bLpc?t=446,

all right if you can pull in and park up on the left just before the black car don't worry about the driveways on this occasion just in that space there so don't worry about the driveways okay that's great there thank you okay well what we're gonna do now is i'd like you to you don't need to chop them up just handbrake and you can relax okay so what we're gonna do now is i'd like you to use the vehicle in front to carry out the parallel park exercise okay so pull over alongside this car in front and reverse back and finish within two car lengths try not to touch the pavement as you do this okay okay,514.159,559.2,606,134,VHmRRX3bLpc,1660,https://youtu.be/VHmRRX3bLpc?t=514,
with all maneuvers you're being marked for two things one is to control whether or not you can get the maneuver done within the required time and space and the second is for your observation whilst you're reversing with the parallel park exercise always remember to look from your right blind spot all the way around until your left blind spot looking out into the rear window whilst reversing it's very important while reversing that you still keep an eye on the road to make sure that nobody is trying to get past you over in the right blind spot if you have a reversing camera in the vehicle that you're learning to drive you are allowed to use this provided you're still looking around over your shoulders before starting to reverse so you can use the camera in addition to your blind spot checks okay you're happy to leave with that yes thank you that's fine drive up when you're ready,579.12,635.6,890,170,VHmRRX3bLpc,1660,https://youtu.be/VHmRRX3bLpc?t=579,
after 80 yards turn right turn right at t junctions when you cannot see the new road clearly use tight clutch control to slowly peep and creep until you can see the new road before you emerge [Music] vehicles on both sides and only one car can fit in the middle of this road it's really important to stay in the middle until you pass the last part vehicle before you move left when it comes to dealing with pedestrians near zebra crossing always be careful because you need to give priority to pedestrians in case they step into the road the pedestrian walking on the narrow footpath is walking with the bicycle and looks over his shoulder martha stops for him in case she does want to cross after stopping for him she quickly moves off this was really good awareness and planning as he could have stepped into the road at any time in the distance ahead there is a bus that's on the bus stop with hazard lights on approach to this hazard always,654.56,749.12,944,187,VHmRRX3bLpc,1660,https://youtu.be/VHmRRX3bLpc?t=654,
be sure to check the bus stop to see if there's any pedestrians getting on and off this will give you an idea to know if the bus is about to move off if the bus is not moving off make sure to look at the road ahead and try and stop at least two to three car lights behind the bar so that you can see the road ahead more clearly and it gives you enough time to get around the bus if it's safe to do so martha didn't realize that the bus was broken down until a little bit later she ends up getting too close to the bus which makes it harder for her to see the road ahead martha is trying to make the most of her seating position to try and lean across to the right to see more of the road ahead but it's difficult with the size of the bus she notices her vehicles coming through so she moves her position back towards the left which ultimately brings her closer to the bus as we're waiting in this position the vehicles behind get impatient and they start overtaking,751.519,809.2,965,204,VHmRRX3bLpc,1660,https://youtu.be/VHmRRX3bLpc?t=751,
as they're going through however there is a motorbike coming through so this would in fact have been a dangerous gap to try and take once again when the road ahead is clear martha checks her mirrors and starts to slowly move towards the right to see the road ahead but this time she notices a double-decker bus coming through as the traffic from the right started entering martha should have moved her position back towards the left as we're slightly over the center line the bus driver in front starts pointing into the space on the left so she quickly reacts and moves out the way this would not go down as a serious fault as martha hasn't actually done anything wrong she's trying her best but she can't see the road ahead this would go down as a minor fault for awareness and planning,810.72,850.079,788,157,VHmRRX3bLpc,1660,https://youtu.be/VHmRRX3bLpc?t=810,

[Music] when turning right into a new road if there are two lanes in the new road aim to turn into the left-hand lane for position normal driving only turn into the right hand lane if you are turning right or overtaking in martha's case this doesn't get counted as a minor fault because the lanes merged soon after had this continued as tulane that she would have needed to move back to the left-hand lane normally when two lanes merge into one one car goes from each lane and combines into a zip pattern you should always use your mirrors towards the direction of the other lane to make sure it's safe to merge martha gets ameera's fault here because she doesn't check her mirrors as the lanes are merging,911.64,963.6,706,146,VHmRRX3bLpc,1660,https://youtu.be/VHmRRX3bLpc?t=911,
after 300 yards on approach to the bus ahead martha starts moving towards the right in position to overtake but then decides against it and moves left she should have checked her mirrors to move right and mirrors towards the left to come back in [Music] martha demonstrates really good lane discipline as she follows the road ahead she started in the left-hand lane and continues forward doing a wide turn turning into the left she then starts to use her mirrors to overtake the bus in the distance turn left when waiting at traffic lights to turn always check your mirrors regularly as cyclists will catch up as you're waiting before moving off to turn left martha checks her mirrors and notices there's a cyclist approaching so she waits for the cyclist before turning as it would have been dangerous to turn with the cyclist there [Music],984.959,1067.94,841,161,VHmRRX3bLpc,1660,https://youtu.be/VHmRRX3bLpc?t=984,

missing a little bit yeah okay especially because motorbikes kept popping popping up here and there you're gonna need to be a bit more alert of your surroundings okay in the later half i felt like you definitely were using a mirror especially on these last few roads a little bit more okay that emergency stop now it was satisfactory but initially it started off quite light you did have that heart like sharp break at the end but initially it started off quite light okay and then the brake came in okay if a child comes running out you need to stop okay okay um so you've got awareness and planning with that bus you know where you struggled a little while now that was the only one that was borderline could have been a serious but it was okay because you stopped now you know the point where the guys behind overtook yeah it wasn't actually safe because there was that motorbike coming right yeah that's what saved you if there was no motorbike and the road was completely clear,1430.08,1482.88,982,191,VHmRRX3bLpc,1660,https://youtu.be/VHmRRX3bLpc?t=1430,
it would have been like wait why are you waiting the guys behind are overtaking yeah and then we had the bit where you you started moving out and now your front was a little bit over but then that car turned and then the bus turned the bus came yeah when that car turned up from that side road you should have come back in okay you kind of you kind of let him go on the pavement yeah he kind of did he did so on his own account yeah and then when the bus turned up i thought come on come back in come back in and you kind of just sat there a little bit but you took a little bit and then the bus driver is like come on get out there yeah so yeah you just need to take the initiative there a little bit kind of go okay well he can't get through let me get out now to save yourself the hassle there did you realize that bus had hazard lights on at the very beginning before you got there no i definitely didn't i just the only thing that i,1484.559,1529.679,937,202,VHmRRX3bLpc,1660,https://youtu.be/VHmRRX3bLpc?t=1484,
realized was that the bus driver was like outside well if she's outside yeah why are we getting this close to the bus yeah so how much space should we have tried to leave there um two cars at least two if not more yeah yeah because now with the bus you you it's a lot bigger than a normal car so you want to have a bit more space so you can see around because you've struggled to look around that bus afterwards didn't you um yeah the parallel park was nice i gave you a miner for control but that's purely because you can normally do that maneuver so much better yeah i know it's been through me that i but yeah you you kind of turned a little bit earlier with that one you guys so remember if you can't use that just lean left gonna go yeah let me go okay a little closer and if i'd have done that and i'd realized i should have like you could have just corrected it a little bit but that's just me being a bit,1531.52,1584.4,912,198,VHmRRX3bLpc,1660,https://youtu.be/VHmRRX3bLpc?t=1531,
extra with that one okay it wasn't that bad so you'd get away with no minor on your maneuver in the test but i know you can do that one a lot better yeah so i'd like for you to be closer on that one yeah okay then we've got position normal driving again this is more of an advisory than an actual fault you know when you turned right at those lights um and then there were two lanes yeah you went into these i went into the right lane yeah so you should have gone in the first one yeah yeah i knew that straight away no it's good because the traffic was so slow moving you could you couldn't really move back but then what got me there was you didn't check your left mirror when the lanes merged that's where these issues were coming in yeah so you should have been away okay well the lane's emerging yeah yeah okay now for a first mock test not bad it is a pass it's good but we can,1586.72,1631.76,883,191,VHmRRX3bLpc,1660,https://youtu.be/VHmRRX3bLpc?t=1586,

you in plenty of time if i don't say anything you're going to keep following the road ahead if you're not sure where you're going you can always ask i'm going to get you to carry out one maneuver and we may also carry out the emergency stop okay now you're not familiar with the area at all so take your time drive nice and safe okay um all right before we get started let's do a quick question could you tell me how would you check that your brakes are working um if you press and depress the brake they shouldn't feel spongy or slack and when you move off they shouldn't pull to one side the car shouldn't pull to one side okay that's fine all right um yeah we're gonna get started so for anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below what you think in hashtags okay and thank you for following along and subscribe because you're even better than i am all right okay we're gonna get started,60.8,111.2,929,198,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=60,

driving behind the cyclist shani maintains a really good distance as it's not safe or necessary to overtake the cyclist as he's riding along pretty quickly,213.84,221.519,155,31,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=213,
as we moved off at this junction shani moves forward and starts driving in the bus lane resulting in a serious fault for response to road markings this may seem a little bit harsh but it's really important to only use bus lanes if we're outside of the operation hours listed on the bus lane sign yeah the wipers are on but they're on a sensor at the moment so if you want them to go a little bit quicker just twist it okay we're gonna go left at the traffic lights,238.72,282.479,464,98,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=238,
even though the lane that we're on is a left only it's really important to signal as the signal will help pedestrians know which way you're going as they may not realize that this is a left only lane at the roundabout timeline,312.16,336.16,226,47,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=312,

shani has really good awareness and planning when it comes to meeting situations as soon as we turned into this road she noticed the oncoming van and she stops in a good position so the van can easily pass,438.72,448.16,205,41,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=438,

here we're going to take the next road on the left it's just after this fan here at the lorry side shani approaches this junction really cautiously and switches back into first gear for better control now we're following the road ahead from here left right you can see the road,510.16,541.279,277,56,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=510,
do what you think,561.6,561.6,17,4,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=561,
the van driver in front parks half on the pavement but the back of his van is still sticking out in the road he gets out and he waves across that there's enough space to get through at this point shani should have gone back down into first gear into clutch control speed and taken that gap much slower at the end turn right i always get my left and right mixed do you want me to give you hand signals instead um and then turning left up here it's when somebody else gives you instructions to go left and right you can see yeah a lot more confusing it's like hold on a minute yeah and my mom is even more confusing because she's like left left no i mean right you know the examiner [Music] okay now take the next road on your left please,594.0,680.48,736,154,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=594,
if you can pull over and park up on the left hand side thank you okay so what we're going to do now using the vehicle in front i'd like you to demonstrate how you would carry out the parallel park exercise okay okay so start alongside the vehicle in the road then reverse back and finish within two columns try not to touch the pavement okay see how this goes,696.0,723.279,359,73,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=696,
oh boy [Music] before starting to reverse shani looks all around making sure to check both blind spots to make sure that nobody's around her she does dry steer when doing this maneuver but that's not necessarily a fault in terms of the driving test she parks the car nicely into the space but forgets to straighten up her tyres meaning that her front tires are still sticking out in the road by the end which results in a minor fault for control with the reverse park um there's no way to put the wing mirror down yeah it's on your door side this one right there that's pretty straight i'm happy with that okay thank you just saying that okay so um thank you um we're going to start the independent driving from here now so i'm going to give you a series of directions to follow if you forget you can ask okay so we're going to move off from here and then turn right and then at the end of that road turn,738.639,820.399,904,190,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=738,
right and then i'll give you some signs after that okay okay so move up when you're ready why'd i keep touching that one [Music] don't know why it's making that one so,822.32,865.199,167,40,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=822,
[Music] at this junction when we were waiting for a safe gap to emerge shani ends up waiting for too long as she's waiting for both sides of the road to clear before emerging the road we're turning onto is quite a wide road so when the right hand side of the road was clear she should have emerged out halfway as there were big gaps on the left that she could have taken,903.05,929.6,370,79,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=903,
okay we're gonna follow some signs now towards central london for a little while,951.12,954.48,80,15,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=951,
oh boy as we're waiting at this roundabout to enter there are no gaps to enter straight away as the roundabout's fairly busy at this position shani's waiting with the clutch half up and the brake on this causes the clutch plates to start rubbing together which causes them to burn up and you could actually smell the clutch burning at this point in terms of a driving test this isn't necessarily a fault as the examiner is not going to mark this down as it doesn't matter to them how you're driving you just need to drive safely but this is not good practice for a new driver as this causes the clutch to burn up and it won't last very long when waiting at this position you should wait with the clutch fully down and only bring the clutch up to the biting point when you're ready to go,974.8,1024.0,786,162,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=974,
two three,1064.32,1068.96,9,2,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=1064,
as you're waiting don't wait with the clutch up okay because that smell that you can smell i was thinking is the clutch burning because if you're not ready to go there's no point of sitting on that point that's there okay do you need to put your hand break up so you should wait with the clutch down and break on and as soon as you want to go it's accelerate bite that's why it's burning so bad,1097.44,1116.64,394,87,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=1097,
always make sure to drive at a safe speed according to the traffic and the road condition as the road surface is wet it's not safe to drive all the way up to 30 miles per hour shani is driving at a really good speed according to the road,1193.44,1205.28,237,52,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=1193,
so on approach to this bus on the bus stop ahead the vehicle in the right hand lane was flashing their headlights to give way but shani didn't realize this in time always make sure that you're checking your mirrors and move over in good time when you're going around buses or overtaking traffic when driving behind this bus on a dual carriageway make sure to leave plenty of space in front as the bus will pull over regularly the more space you have in front and the earlier you use your mirrors and signal the easier it will be to pass the bus shani deals with the bus on the bus stop really calmly she ends up getting stuck behind the bus but she leaves a little bit of space in front the lane on the right is flowing quite fast so it's not safe to move over when it is safe to move over she checks her mirrors and moves over it's a good idea to check your blind spot at this point as you're moving off at an angle,1225.76,1287.84,916,194,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=1225,

okay that'll be the end of your independent driving i'm going to give you directions as normal from now on okay okay so we're going to be we're going to be turning right pretty soon there's going to be two traffic light junctions they're really close together i want you to turn right at the second one and they're pretty close together the first one i'm going straight yeah okay and then we're turning right so straight here right right down there yeah,1342.4,1382.08,453,93,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=1342,

as we go around this bend there's a roundabout ahead at the roundabout we're following the road ahead and you need to stay in the right hand lane as that's the only lane that goes straight we're just following the road ahead okay ends up getting into the left only lane at the roundabout from this position she now should have signaled left and just gone left she didn't realize the road marking and then continues to follow the road ahead this would be a serious fault,1440.96,1468.08,469,95,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=1440,
that's when your video is supposed to turn the engine off but i've never been to one of these yeah normally when you're waiting you can see that green sign here not idling yeah so you should press it yeah you can just switch it off you smell how bad it got earlier yeah i was like what is that yeah you were sitting right on the biting point and it's just burning those plates together do you do that in your own car yeah does it smell no i have a petrol maybe that's why it's probably just because you've burnt the plates out already oh my god actually there has been a couple times it has smell but obviously i didn't know what it was i was like what is that yeah i'm not telling you no she's like probably from outside i was like when you first teach them do they do that no oh that's just me it's when you don't realize what it is you'll do it [Music] you've just switched it off again,1484.64,1555.52,889,197,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=1484,
yeah you just need to press the start button masks here,1562.24,1563.52,55,11,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=1562,
driving through the high street shani drives at a really good pace considering both sides of the road and scanning as she's going through always be alert as somebody may step into the road and drivers may move out in front of you or open the door as you're driving through as the park vehicles are really close to the road,1591.44,1607.12,322,65,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=1591,
traffic lights turn right but turning right at the traffic light shani should have signaled a little bit later as there are a few entrances on the right and we're traveling quite slowly she gets into a really good position at the traffic lights to make this right turn you can see the vehicle in front is more in position for going ahead rather than turning right this position can be very misleading to others around you,1633.44,1654.88,421,79,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=1633,
the next road on your left,1675.039,1675.039,26,6,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=1675,

if you can pull over and park on the left just behind the car but avoid driveways on this occasion just keep going a little bit further you don't need to be too close that'll be great thank you just over here and secure the car keys and then switch off the engine as well okay that is the end of your test if you just give me a few minutes for 40 minutes it was a little bit over actually it's quite a long test that was that was quick okay um all right that's the end of your test give me a few minutes sure okay unfortunately it wouldn't be a pass on this occasion okay yeah and it's one thing um no not the bus um there is one thing that kind of repeated itself oh dear response to road markings oh so the first thing quite early on which i was gonna um oversee a little bit you know when you were distracted by the wipers yeah and then you kind of went into the bus lane yeah yeah yeah so that's the,1749.2,1821.2,903,197,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=1749,
first one you shouldn't be driving in a bus lane yeah so road markings okay the next one came on right at the end there so we're coming up to this roundabout which is just after a bend and then we were going straight at that roundabout yeah in order to go straight the right hand lane had a straight arrow the left hand lane had a left only arrow it was faded and it's raining so you couldn't see the left one yeah and then you've gone into the left only lane and then you've got a head which is more to the right yeah so you've used the left only lane and gone ahead on a roundabout okay okay the mini one it was the mini roundabout before we stopped at that level crossing yeah okay so that's where the second mistakes come in but um there's generally a lot of hesitation that roundabout were you hesitated with the clutches burning yeah yeah you need to find the right gap and you,1823.36,1870.72,883,190,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=1823,
know be on your way yeah then that the um t-junction where the independent driving started we sat there for a while oh yeah where the bus was on the bus stop yeah so that one there um and also um that roundabout where you went into the left only lane yeah your right was completely empty there was about four cars coming in from your left but you're waiting for them do we need to wait for them no yeah so they're on your left aren't they yeah had you entered they would have stopped but you're in the left only lane as well so they don't expect you to come forward from the ground yeah yeah so yeah um your parallel parking exercise was really good great observation great control okay the only thing you got marked down on that one is your steering control you didn't straighten up your tires oh okay your tires were still facing the road uh-huh yeah okay yeah you could see with the car in front that we were straight yeah give me a second yeah no that's basically that and then,1872.159,1929.919,981,203,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=1872,
on the carriageway there was a little bit of awareness and planning there was that bus that was going on to the bus stop which you clearly saw yeah but you're not making any sort of advances to move over yeah the car behind was actually flashing the lights to give you way yeah but then you left it a bit late but again it's so small that i didn't really bother it's not necessarily a big fault there because the bus didn't exactly wait for too long yeah yeah and then on one occasion use of speed uh on a 30 road where you were initially driving 40 it went to 30 you were still 34 oh and then you gradually slowed it down yeah yeah did you realize that mistake with the um road marking at the roundabout at all no i didn't you know okay what about the bus la bus lane yeah yeah the bus lane i looked at and i was like oh because normally i don't know because it,1931.6,1977.12,862,190,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=1931,
because it was like a one it was a one room it was a one way so right in front of us when we got to that junction we had a bus lane and the other lane yeah so we had to just drive straight in yeah yeah we can use bus lanes if the timing is right okay so overall you do have really good awareness but there's some of these little points that um we're gonna go address now but um you should be good to go because then sorry in terms of where you're driving for your test you're a lot more familiar with the area so i don't think these mistakes will happen there yeah but just be a bit more mindful with like dealing with the buses and things like that give a bit more space when dealing with meetings as well you squeeze through a lot of the small gaps quite quickly you did so nicely so i didn't have to intervene at all but um just take your time with it you remember the bit with a van the guy kind of mounted the pavement yeah yeah,1979.279,2024.08,933,200,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=1979,
i know he was telling you to go yeah but just think wait can i fit yeah and then just go through it really slow using clutch control rather than just going through yeah yeah but now overall really well done i wish you the best of luck with your test thank you okay but yeah well done okay um thank you for everyone that's been watching hopefully that information was useful don't forget to like comment and subscribe but yeah thank you bye [Music],2026.96,2053.79,447,89,E_pLd6Bx_4Q,2054,https://youtu.be/E_pLd6Bx_4Q?t=2026,
stop it stop that [Music] hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving my name is aman and today i'm doing a mock test with sherwin he um contacted me online to do a mock test because his driving test is in a few days time so he wanted to get another point of view and we're still driving in the area where his test is so that's pretty good you'll get a few more um practice on the roundabouts around here and you're happy for this to go up on youtube yes yes yes yeah okay so um do you want me to tell you a little bit about the test before we get started okay so um throughout the drive i want you to follow the road ahead yeah whenever i need you to turn i will tell you in plenty of time if i don't say anything i want you to keep going straight and if you're not sure where you're going you can always ask okay now before we get started i'm going to,3.199,63.12,855,193,6rzQmJ74kyo,1667,https://youtu.be/6rzQmJ74kyo?t=3,
ask you a quick question yeah all right could you tell me where do you find the information for the recommended tire pressure and how do you check this um you find it on the manufacturer's book okay and then you find a reliable cage okay and then you check it brilliant sounds good all right so um i'm going to get you to follow the sat now from here actually so that'll be your independent driving starting straight away um yeah so we're gonna get started we're gonna do one maneuver and we may also carry out the emergency stop yeah for anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below how you think sherwin's doing and don't forget to subscribe to the channel if you haven't already alright ready [Music] take two let's do this all right so start the engine and then drive from here and the sat nav should start off,64.479,112.24,852,175,6rzQmJ74kyo,1667,https://youtu.be/6rzQmJ74kyo?t=64,
[Music] after 100 yards when you first start the driving test you're bound to be a little bit nervous so be sure not to take junctions too quickly approach with caution and look carefully before you enter on approach to this first junction sherwin starts looking on approach and continues without stopping it's a good idea to take the first few junctions slowly as they could have been a vehicle approaching at speed cross the roundabout and take the second exit,138.52,169.68,462,90,6rzQmJ74kyo,1667,https://youtu.be/6rzQmJ74kyo?t=138,
okay we can pull over and park up on the left just before the next park car don't worry about the driveways on this occasion yep just after not too close okay okay so whenever you're ready move off,213.68,230.64,197,43,6rzQmJ74kyo,1667,https://youtu.be/6rzQmJ74kyo?t=213,
[Music] after 200 yards turn left to turn left at the traffic lights the lane is obstructed with the vehicle from the right slightly turned sherwin should not have gone through the narrow gap as the vehicle on the right would continue to turn as the lights went green [Music],250.46,280.34,275,57,6rzQmJ74kyo,1667,https://youtu.be/6rzQmJ74kyo?t=250,
you driving down this road sherwin doesn't realize that he ends up exceeding the speed limit he's driving up to 34 miles per hour on a 30 miles per hour road but as he does slow down this wouldn't necessarily be counted as a serious fault because he does slow down after 300 yards turn right when you're turning in 300 yards use the sat nav to see how many turns are before the one you're taking and start counting the roads sherwin nearly misses this turn as he hasn't realized where he's turning at 100 yards the satnav will repeat the instruction again so we're turning here turn right [Music],308.56,357.31,596,129,6rzQmJ74kyo,1667,https://youtu.be/6rzQmJ74kyo?t=308,
so [Music] after 200 yards cross the roundabout and take the second exit cross the roundabout and take the second exit [Music],375.199,412.93,126,29,6rzQmJ74kyo,1667,https://youtu.be/6rzQmJ74kyo?t=375,
you can pull over and park up on the left anywhere safe sherwin should have parked somewhere where the pavement was raised even next to a car would have been okay but not in front of driveways after 200 yards cross the roundabout and take the second exit thank you drive off whenever you're ready sharon does really well when he moves off as he prepares the car looks all around making sure to check his right blind spot again as a final check before moving away [Music] cross the roundabout and take the second exit sherwin notices the oncoming vehicle at speed and he slows down and stops at a good position and checks his mirrors to the right before moving off it's always a good idea to check your mirrors as there may have been a motorbike approaching after 200 yards go left on the roundabout and take the first exit [Music] go left on the roundabout and take the first exit [Music],428.639,526.64,888,185,6rzQmJ74kyo,1667,https://youtu.be/6rzQmJ74kyo?t=428,
okay if you can pull over and park up on the right-hand side of the road then turn left i'll be right there so what i'd like you to do next is to reverse back for about two car lengths keeping reasonably close to and parallel to the pavement as you carry out the exercise try not to touch the pavement before starting to reverse sherwin looks all around making sure that both blind spots are clear and nobody is passing him in the road as he starts to reverse as he's reversing he's looking all around keeping an eye on his left blind spot while reversing he's not looking over his right blind spot as much which can be an issue if somebody had stepped out from the right hand side and one of the driveways so that he gets marked down for a minor fault for this i'll go back when you've done about two car lengths you can stop i'll be fine there thank you dragon from if you're ready,543.92,621.92,883,185,6rzQmJ74kyo,1667,https://youtu.be/6rzQmJ74kyo?t=543,
so at the end of the road turn right a4020 then turn left as we moved off to turn right at this traffic light junction the new road has another traffic light soon after sherwin didn't realize that those traffic lights were red and i had to tell him to stop [Music] don't stop that stop that stop it stop that you can go now as you turn into a new road there may be a pedestrian crossing soon after there's usually space for about two cars to be able to line up straight always make sure if there's a solid line you should stop there after 100 yards turn left then cross the roundabout and take the second exit turn left then cross the roundabout and take the second exit the speed limit on this new road is 30 miles per hour but with the steep speed bumps and the bends and turns on this road it's not necessarily safe to drive up to 30 miles per hour always drive at a safe speed according to the road conditions,641.12,739.6,913,195,6rzQmJ74kyo,1667,https://youtu.be/6rzQmJ74kyo?t=641,
cross the roundabout and take the second exit [Music],743.04,746.48,53,12,6rzQmJ74kyo,1667,https://youtu.be/6rzQmJ74kyo?t=743,
you can use the sun visor after 200 yards go left on the roundabout and take the first exit [Music] go left on the roundabout and take the first exit [Music] go left on the roundabout and take the second exit sherwin doesn't slow down enough for this next roundabout and continues taking it in third gear [Music],777.6,832.62,312,72,6rzQmJ74kyo,1667,https://youtu.be/6rzQmJ74kyo?t=777,
after 250 yards cross the roundabout and take the first exit [Music] cross the roundabout and take the first exit [Music],861.04,881.51,121,28,6rzQmJ74kyo,1667,https://youtu.be/6rzQmJ74kyo?t=861,
cross the roundabout and take the second exit [Music] after 200 yards go right on the roundabout and take the third exit so just to give you a little heads up there's actually two round butts here at the first one we're doing a left and the second one we're doing the right when moving off in traffic like this always be sure to check your mirrors and also look behind your windscreen pillars as pedestrians can very easily hide behind that blind spot on this roundabout sherwin gets a serious fault for junction observation as he starts to move forward as the motorbike is still on the roundabout but mostly because there was a van on the right hand side who started to enter and we should have waited for them go right on the roundabout and take the third exit the undo hesitation on this junction is very brief so it's not necessarily a minor fault the entry into the new road was initially blocked so it wasn't safe to enter,904.8,1005.04,928,190,6rzQmJ74kyo,1667,https://youtu.be/6rzQmJ74kyo?t=904,
sherwin notices the width restriction ahead he slows down in good time and selects an appropriate gear to get through carefully [Music] okay sure when if you can pull over and park up on the left hand side anywhere along here [Music] that's great though thank you okay so that's the end of your independent driving yeah i'm gonna give you directions as normal from now on okay so whenever you're ready follow the road ahead [Music] okay when we get to the roundabout turn left [Music],1026.959,1104.34,484,101,6rzQmJ74kyo,1667,https://youtu.be/6rzQmJ74kyo?t=1026,
as we're going forward there's a slip road which comes in quite suddenly as we're going forward the road's going to bend towards the left quite sharply and there's a small slip road to get up to the speed of the road before joining sherwin deals with the slip road really well making great progress before joining the main road always make sure to use the full length of the slip pro to speed up and use lower gears to make better progress,1125.6,1147.28,439,89,6rzQmJ74kyo,1667,https://youtu.be/6rzQmJ74kyo?t=1125,
[Music] okay and when it's safe to do so i'd like you to demonstrate how you would de-miss the front windscreen you can turn it off,1169.01,1194.64,131,33,6rzQmJ74kyo,1667,https://youtu.be/6rzQmJ74kyo?t=1169,
all right the next roundabout take the third exit right please third exit,1223.44,1225.28,73,14,6rzQmJ74kyo,1667,https://youtu.be/6rzQmJ74kyo?t=1223,

all right if you can pull in and park up on the left just here please [Music] not too close okay that's great thank you secure the car you can switch off the engine as well all right give me a few minutes i'm just gonna look at this all right so that's the end of your test how was the drive for you that's right but i'm not filled up okay so where did you fail the traffic lights yeah and i think that was another one for speeding or like the gap whereabouts do you know um the hit the roundabout yeah i feel i was pretty forced yeah so there's um there's a few few issues and the first one the obvious one being the traffic light yes clearly red body was seated you didn't see it right and then when it went green i had to wake you up a little bit as well okay so yeah obviously as soon as you're turning in if there's a traffic light you need to look at that because that's,1331.12,1392.0,876,195,6rzQmJ74kyo,1667,https://youtu.be/6rzQmJ74kyo?t=1331,
a different traffic light from the one we started with okay um the next one being your observation when we got to the high street haze town yeah where we were going straight and there was that motorbike on the roundabout and then there was a silver van yeah i should wait for the morgan well the motorbikes on the roundabout and you've entered and then as you've entered the vans right there so you shouldn't have gone at that point yeah so you've got a serious fault for the observation on that one as well and then um use of speed sometimes firstly you went over speed on a 30 you were about 34 at one point on the 50 you went to about 53 54 at one point and just there wasn't that bad it was minus but it's just i just feel like sometimes you treat the speed limit like a goal like you need to get to it and it was really only a concern when there were lots of parked cars around,1393.44,1441.6,882,194,6rzQmJ74kyo,1667,https://youtu.be/6rzQmJ74kyo?t=1393,
you and you're still trying to go fast yeah do you feel like you do that i do that a lot yeah so that's that needs to be a little bit slower so you've got to be mindful what if someone steps into the road yeah then there was that roundabout that you took in third where the car was struggling a little bit oh yeah guys it changed back to second yeah why are you doing roundabouts in third gear yeah yeah okay and the last one was this big round about here when we were turning right you came into that round about really nicely you're going round yeah as you're going around you saw that lady in the grey car yes she poked out a little bit yes now you know you're leaving yes she's slightly encroaching into your space but you should have carried on moving towards the left gradually to leave you've checked your mirrors you've signaled and then you've pulled back to the right what if there was someone on,1443.039,1486.32,906,191,6rzQmJ74kyo,1667,https://youtu.be/6rzQmJ74kyo?t=1443,
your right not that i was looking but there was no one but i didn't want to go to the to our side no no i know but just slowly start moving back you don't need to commit 100 into that lane you know you have to leave she wasn't exactly out okay so slowly come over and then the big concern with that use of mirrors change direction there was actually when you came off the roundabout you're on the right hand lane yes yeah but as you're going on the right hand lane you're kind of encroaching into the left space now where there was a little fiat 500 behind you yeah it just feels like you were just coming off a bit too fast that your steering control didn't seem all that great at that point so i think going a little bit slower there would have helped you out yeah okay okay so in terms of okay let me put this away now so in terms of my advice to you going forward yeah you know you said at the very beginning that you take gaps a,1487.76,1535.84,933,203,6rzQmJ74kyo,1667,https://youtu.be/6rzQmJ74kyo?t=1487,
bit too quick yes i do yeah there were two clearance faults as well one of them being the obvious one right at the beginning those traffic lights onto yeting fork yeah getting lane sorry as we were going left there was a black car already sticking out at an angle kind of in the lane on the right yeah the gap next to him is quite tight you can see there's space for you at the other end but in order to get past that you need to go through this tight gap where he's turned now the traffic lights went green by the time we were going forward so that means he's going to look ahead and start moving and come into your lane a bit more he was pissed off that you went past him at that point is it yeah yeah because i was thinking oh god if that car moves i'm going to have to brake tight gaps take them slower in terms of the width restriction you did that really well you know the one with the the pillars on the sides oh yeah,1537.36,1585.2,924,195,6rzQmJ74kyo,1667,https://youtu.be/6rzQmJ74kyo?t=1537,
barbells yeah you went over that one really nicely you kind of really slowed it down wiggle through that was great so the advice i'm going to give you now for your test is actually just to make sure you're always driving at a safe speed for the road cool so if you're in the target yeah not always trying to hit the target so like when we were driving through the high street coming up to that point you were just trying to speed up a little bit where it wasn't really safe i know it says 30 but is it safe to do 30. no yeah and then we had um the 50 road you know the slip road where you joined the 50 road you did really well on that slip road and the guy fleshed or i just wasn't yeah but again just really make sure that when you're joining a slip road especially a really small slip road like that you need to use the full length yeah yeah okay so how would you summarize your uh mock test today how,1587.12,1633.12,904,201,6rzQmJ74kyo,1667,https://youtu.be/6rzQmJ74kyo?t=1587,
was the experience of this mock fashion experience was good but the driving not so good i need to improve i think um just if you start being a little bit slower and cautious around the busier parts you'll be fine so that will not really be an issue anymore okay all right so that's the end of our mock test today hopefully some of this information was useful for you guys and you learn from sherwin's mistakes um but yeah good luck with your test let us know how it goes thank you okay all right bye [Music],1635.279,1665.93,507,106,6rzQmJ74kyo,1667,https://youtu.be/6rzQmJ74kyo?t=1635,
take the exit a312 then [Music] hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving my name is aman and today i'm doing a mock test with mayo now he contacted me online because his test is coming up soon and we're in the area where his driving test is so you're quite lucky with that and you get to practice um similar roads now um you've never done a driving test before no and you've have you ever done a mock test with your instructor oh no okay that's fine but you know what's kind of involved what's expected from you okay that's fine and how many hours of driving have you done so far would you say um about 30. about 30 from complete beginner yeah okay all right so um throughout the drive i want you to follow the road ahead whenever i need you to turn i will tell you if i don't say anything you're going to keep going straight but i am going to get you to start the,4.88,59.28,869,193,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=4,
independent driving from here so we're going to follow the sat nav for the first 15-20 minutes or so okay and then i'm going to give you instructions normally from there on now we are going to do one maneuver and we may also carry out the emergency stop okay similar to everything you've already been practicing with your instructor you just need to be safe so don't worry if you go the wrong way just stay nice and calm okay okay okay so before we get driving could you tell me how would you check if your headrest is correctly adjusted so the rigid part should be like aligned with your eye yeah and um the top of the part should like yeah that's great that's fine thank you okay now before we get started for anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below on how you think myers driving's going and subscribe to the channel if you haven't already all right so we're going to get started now,60.48,110.159,929,194,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=60,
so we've already had a little bit of a drive so he's used to the car by now so when you're ready i want you to start the engine and then drive off,112.479,123.2,146,36,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=112,
[Music] at the end of the road turn right then turn left turn right then turn left [Music] turn left then take the second right on approach to this next turning mirror should have slowed down further as there are part vehicles on the entrance and you can't see into the new road mayor generally has really good awareness all around as he regularly checks his mirrors before moving around parked vehicles [Music] after 80 yards turn right turn right when driving down residential roads with parked vehicles on both sides it's really important to position your vehicle in the center of the road leaving a good clearance all around your vehicle at the end of the road turn right mayer approaches this next junction really confidently as we get to the very end he can't see both sides but he keeps looking carefully until he's in a better position and commits without hesitation,149.17,270.88,874,166,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=149,
[Music] you can pull over and park up on the left just here that's great thank you and drive off whenever you're ready to prepare the car to move off mayor gets the car ready looks all around checking from his left blind spot all the way around till his right blind spot before moving off there were a few vehicles approaching so he decided to wait for them but before moving off he doesn't check his right blind spot again he gets a minor fault for moving off safety as he's not checking his right blind spot but this would have gone down serious had somebody been in that blind spot as he moved off it's always a good idea to check your top mirror your right mirror and your right blind spot as a final check before moving away [Music] go left on the roundabout and take the first exit at this roundabout mayor gets a minor fault for control steering as he doesn't position his vehicle round towards the left and nearly goes in towards the right-hand lane [Music],287.86,387.5,965,197,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=287,
in the new road mirror makes good progress with the speed of the road and also as the road splits into two lanes he sticks to the left lane which is the position normal driving only move into the right hand lane if you're overtaking or turning right [Music],389.759,413.16,257,53,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=389,
take the next entrance on your right so i'm just gonna give you the next instruction [Music],430.8,439.21,92,20,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=430,
okay mayor i'd like you to forward park into any space just make sure you finish within the lines okay finish within a bill to forward park into a bay it's always a lot easier to start slightly further away from the space so that you have more space to turn in and to straighten up the car mayor starts his maneuver from the middle of the road resulting in him parking in the opposite bay he was then forced to have to reverse in order to correct his parking,459.039,485.599,458,93,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=459,
yeah do whatever you think is safe before starting to reverse you need to look all around making sure to check both left and right blind spot mayo looks all around but doesn't check his left blind spot and reverses back for about the length of a car before he looks around as nobody was really around us at this point it wasn't a big issue but he should have been checking left blind spot as well,524.64,551.519,396,80,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=524,
thank you that's fine you can reverse that [Music],585.6,599.7,50,12,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=585,
hmm okay we're gonna go back to following the sat nav again,616.399,628.16,59,14,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=616,
so continue following the sat nav again okay [Music] after 300 yards go right on the roundabout and take the fourth exit a312 [Music] mayor starts the roundabout in the correct position as he goes round he needs to be in either of the two right hand lanes go right on the roundabout and take the fourth exit a312 as he goes into the roundabout he takes the right most lane once he's in this lane he needs to now start to spiral and keep to the line on the left-hand side in order to be able to exit mayer ends up getting into the new lane which is actually designed to go back round where he entered [Music] take the exit a312 then turn left at this point mayor stays really nice and calm and goes round the roundabout and takes whatever exit he can safely take if he had tried to change direction at this point that would have resulted in more of a serious fault but he doesn't get a fault as he simply,655.839,752.639,903,196,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=655,
goes the wrong way [Music],754.48,758.49,26,8,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=754,
okay we're headed the wrong way now so what we're going to do is when we get to the next roundabout we're going to make a u-turn it's the full flexi after 300 yards go around the roundabout and take the fourth exit a312 go around the roundabout and take the fourth exit [Music],812.56,844.42,277,67,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=812,
mayor does this round about really confidently as he's going around the roundabout he's counting the exits and he sees the third exit and starts using his mirrors positioning outwards and signals to take the exit take the exit a312 okay we're still following the saturn okay after 300 yards cross the roundabout and take the third exit a312 on this next round about mayor needs to take the third exit which is past 12 o'clock it would be a good idea to start in the right hand lane or even the middle lane as we get to the top of the roundabout mayor starts in the far left lane which does not allow him to take the third exit [Music] cross the roundabout and take the third exit [Music],864.88,932.77,687,148,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=864,
take the exit a312 then turn left okay just ignore the sat nav now just carry on following the road ahead turn around when possible then at the end of the road turn left right then turn right,960.88,979.519,191,39,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=960,
go right on the roundabout and take the third exit [Music] take the exit a40 after three quarters of a mile take the exit towards north old when joining a slip road from an angle it's always a good idea to lean forward towards the steering to see more of your blind spot in the side mirror mayor doesn't do this so he didn't notice there was somebody in the middle lane it's a good idea to do this in case somebody from the middle is trying to switch into the left hand lane take the exit towards north the lane that we're in comes off the dual carriageway mayor starts signaling left to take the exit but he does not need to signal,1013.199,1101.28,632,136,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=1013,
83 straight ahead second exit go left on the roundabout and take the first exit so that's the end of your independent driving okay i'm going to give you directions from now on so we're taking the road ahead second exit,1120.4,1146.559,218,45,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=1120,
as we moved off from this position mayor needed to drive forward into the roundabout checking his mirrors towards the right to drive into the lane to go ahead but he goes the wrong way going the wrong way is not a big issue but this is the third time we've gone the wrong way and they've all been at roundabouts it just shows that mayo is not very confident when it comes to selecting the correct lane at roundabouts if you keep going the wrong way and the examiner is not able to conduct the test and do all the checks then it could be an issue as they could terminate their tests for language and communication after those traffic lights turn right yep just after there's a right turn we're turning right okay [Music] we're turning right there [Music] right you might want to change gear by the way it's fine just carry on driving your head now okay a short while i'm going to ask you to make a right turn,1163.84,1249.44,907,189,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=1163,
okay now we're going to be taking the,1277.039,1277.039,37,9,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=1277,
okay now we're going to be taking the next road on your right that's coming up shortly [Music],1277.039,1283.04,94,22,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=1277,
now turn left mary deals with the meeting situation really confidently making sure to get completely over to the left in order to give way to the oncoming vehicle mayor deals with the width restriction ahead really well slowing down the vehicle to continue through,1302.64,1333.679,264,46,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=1302,
[Music] time right [Music] okay when it's safe to do so i'd like you to demonstrate how you would de-miss the rear windscreen [Music] that's pretty good thank you you can turn it off thank you [Music] do [Music] we're going ahead from here [Music],1354.25,1426.04,247,64,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=1354,
take the next road on your left case,1451.36,1451.36,36,8,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=1451,
at the end of the road turn right [Music] you can pull in and park up on the left i'm just behind the white car so we'll really tuck into that space there that'll be fine there thank you that's great leave enough space to move away all right so what we're going to do now is i'm going to get you to now carry out the emergency stop okay so as you're driving down this road i want you to imagine that you had to stop the car as quickly as possible as if your child had come running out in front of you i'm gonna make sure it's safe so wait for my signal my signal will be stop and when i say that i want you to stop the car as quickly and as safely as possible okay all right so whenever you're ready let's drive off from here,1477.6,1543.2,725,166,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=1477,
it's really important that with the emergency stop you stop the car as quickly and as safely as possible you do not check your mirrors you do not signal or move the vehicle from the center of the road you just need to stop the car the first emergency stop from my era was really quite slow and it wasn't safe so i got him to do it again now the examiner won't always give you a second chance with the emergency stop as you need to stop quickly okay so we're still doing okay so we're still doing the emergency stop yeah just wait for my signal [Music] stop um move off whenever you're ready okay so shortly i'm going to get you to do that again okay it needs to be a quick stop stop okay thank you drive off whenever you're ready and then pull in the park up on the left anywhere along here okay probably fine there thank you security card can switch off the engine brilliant okay give me a few minutes okay all right,1566.159,1677.84,917,191,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=1566,
okay so how was the drive for you terrible we went off track like three four times [Music] how are you finding roundabouts terrible yeah yeah you know what you're doing yeah okay but i just felt like you you didn't know which lane to follow yeah that's a little bit off at the moment now unfortunately it would be a fail on this occasion and yeah yeah then there was the gear issue you stalled twice and i stopped you from stalling the third time because i said to you listen you need to change gears because on that particular road i thought if you'd stalled it was gonna take too long and plus it was third there was no chance you could have made that okay um your emergency stop how was that i've never done one before oh it's an emergency a child has come running out in front of you how was your break fast was it fast yeah really it really didn't feel fast it felt so slow the first time was not sufficient,1679.2,1736.24,912,190,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=1679,
it was not great the second time you know you tried to break but again you're just letting it roll you should have a quick stop don't let it roll don't try and do a smooth break okay um a few of the faults i want to go over firstly your um forward bay park yeah you had to reverse didn't you now you knew you were parking on the right why didn't you start further on the left because then you'd have more space to go forward and not need to reverse because you could have fixed it in one go then i just want to talk about your moving off safety so this happened early on and this happened again afterwards which i forgot to put down so that actually would have been another give me one second just so that i remember so with the moving off safety what you do is you you're checking all around which is great and then you can see that there's three or four cars and you're waiting for them right so what you're doing is you're checking the right mirror waiting waiting waiting and those,1739.039,1787.279,985,206,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=1739,
decisions are old yes yeah so you need to check again and it's mainly that right blind spot check that that you need to do again because you're checking top and right and then it's clear after this van you should go top right and blind spot okay okay um so yeah there was one time that the traffic lights went green you just sat there for a little while oh yeah in the roundabout yeah i wasn't sure yeah but you knew you were going the wrong way just stick to it now there's there's nothing we can do at that point right yeah yeah okay so um the roundabouts we're gonna go over them a little bit now so i'll go give you some pointers with that okay okay um i'll give you some pointers with all of this now so um how was this mock test for you is it what you expected yeah i mean i've never done a mock so i didn't know what i needed help with yeah so this is but with the areas i've highlighted were,1789.12,1843.76,899,199,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=1789,
you aware of those like the roundabouts i mean some exits i'm alright with but like some i'm not the roundabouts without the traffic lights you're fine it's the traffic light roundabouts that you have trouble with because if you think about that one roundabout i was trying to get you to do we got it wrong on both occasions didn't we yeah the north one yeah the north one you know it as well yeah thank you for everyone that's been watching hopefully that video was useful and you've learned a few tips along the way from myers driving but yeah don't forget to give it a thumbs up and comment down below what you thought of his driving and subscribe to the channel if you haven't already bye [Music],1845.76,1885.64,700,147,fPMnm1PTUeE,1895,https://youtu.be/fPMnm1PTUeE?t=1845,
that's uh that one that was odd you know i'm actually a joke what the was that it's just stupidity so i would never do that when i'm driving normally why am i nervous [Music] hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving today i'm doing sort of a mock test with adrian now this is the second time that we're driving together actually so the first time was when he drove a manual car for the first time how was that traumatic experience now i'm joking it was it was good but very difficult yeah well you got the hang of it by the end yeah but it was like unlearning the automatic instincts yes so that's that's way harder when you start in an automatic then try and go back to manual yeah normally pushing the accelerator and yeah now you got the hang of it at the end okay so today's lesson um today's mock test is just going to be where i'm actually in his car so he knows the,1.12,58.64,877,191,SXsv4UuDerQ,1796,https://youtu.be/SXsv4UuDerQ?t=1,
controls and he's really familiar with the size of his vehicle so we're just going to do a drive for about 35 40 minutes as if this was a test and we're going to see if he would pass because you've been driving for a little while on your own now and everyone tends to get a few habits and doing their own things yeah i'm going to switch all of that off now if you don't know you doing already he does um he's on tick tock and on youtube as in the dark vlogs do you want to introduce yourself um my name is adrian as you said i do sort of like skits on tiktok and youtube and some longer form videos on there as well so be sure to go follow him guys okay now we're actually starting a lot later than we were meant to so um adrian had a bit of an accident with his uh tire which we managed to fix but um he's learnt a few things today my hands are a,60.8,108.159,847,197,SXsv4UuDerQ,1796,https://youtu.be/SXsv4UuDerQ?t=60,
bit mucky i don't know if you can see it if you guys are new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below on how you think adrian does and don't forget to subscribe to the channel and to adrian and in the dark vlog so i will tag that in the video alright so you ready okay so i'm gonna tell you a little bit about how the test is gonna go and if there's any questions ask away so throughout the drive follow the road ahead whenever i need you to turn i'll tell you plenty of time if i don't say anything i want you to keep going straight okay now this is going to be how your driving test was so i want you to make sure that you're driving safe at all yeah no of course okay um if you're not sure where you're going always ask okay okay i'm going to get you to possibly do a maneuver as well and maybe even the emergency stop okay okay yeah all right so we're going to,110.32,157.28,888,201,SXsv4UuDerQ,1796,https://youtu.be/SXsv4UuDerQ?t=110,

speed limits 20 and a tire that's not flat at the end of the road turn left adrian doesn't check his mirrors before signaling but he does check his mirrors before he turns as a new driver it's always a good idea to check your mirrors every time before you indicate to turn [Music] ah why am i nervous at the end of the road turn right,182.4,225.2,334,74,SXsv4UuDerQ,1796,https://youtu.be/SXsv4UuDerQ?t=182,

when waiting on the side of the road while giving way always check your mirrors towards the right before moving off in case of any overtaking vehicles adrian's got good spatial awareness with the size of his vehicle as he's been driving for a little while on his own he deals with all the meeting situations really well and checks his mirrors as he moves in and out and turn right,260.16,284.56,380,75,SXsv4UuDerQ,1796,https://youtu.be/SXsv4UuDerQ?t=260,

i couldn't actually see his indicator because of the sun i thought he was going straight,358.639,361.52,88,17,SXsv4UuDerQ,1796,https://youtu.be/SXsv4UuDerQ?t=358,
adrian does have a habit of steering with just one hand this isn't necessarily a fault as long as you don't lose grip of the steering wheel whilst turning but as a new driver it's always a good idea to use both hands and use the pull and push motion for steering at whoa must be nice,378.479,409.52,283,62,SXsv4UuDerQ,1796,https://youtu.be/SXsv4UuDerQ?t=378,
adrian takes the gap from the right quite confidently making sure to cross the path of the oncoming vehicle quite quickly and speeding up into the new road so he doesn't slow them down,430.56,437.44,184,37,SXsv4UuDerQ,1796,https://youtu.be/SXsv4UuDerQ?t=430,
adrian notices the 40 signs in the distance and starts to speed up well before the 40 zone begins you can start to speed up before the new zone begins but make sure it's safe and that you're within close proximity,463.199,473.12,213,46,SXsv4UuDerQ,1796,https://youtu.be/SXsv4UuDerQ?t=463,
[Music] as we're driving along on this road the vehicle in front is now driving 10 miles per hour under the speed limit when this happens always make sure to maintain a good following distance of at least two seconds,488.71,505.039,216,44,SXsv4UuDerQ,1796,https://youtu.be/SXsv4UuDerQ?t=488,
questionable entering up the main road bar okay when we get to the roundabout take the fifth exit okay,537.68,557.36,102,21,SXsv4UuDerQ,1796,https://youtu.be/SXsv4UuDerQ?t=537,
if it's past the second one i always count allowed because otherwise i just lose count adrian starts the roundabout in the right-hand lane as his exit is past 12 o'clock as he goes round the roundabout he counts the exits out loud to keep himself on track,574.399,589.44,255,55,SXsv4UuDerQ,1796,https://youtu.be/SXsv4UuDerQ?t=574,
[Music] one that's actually two that one this is what i'm saying [Music] three as he's passing the fourth exit he should have gone into the left-hand lane to exit more easily he thought that there may be two lanes on the exit so he went into the overtaking position [Music] it was safe right losing focus this is 30 or 20. assuming because of the streets it's 30 because of street lights unless specified that's what i'm going with the street lamps along this road indicate that it's a 30 miles per hour limit if it was anything above or below that number you will get signs repeated throughout if it was a 20 miles per hour zone you will also get some traffic calming measures when it's safe to do so i'd like you to demonstrate how you would switch on the front demister,605.32,713.76,772,170,SXsv4UuDerQ,1796,https://youtu.be/SXsv4UuDerQ?t=605,
at this roundabout adrian makes a serious fault with response to road marking as he turns into the wrong side of the road that's uh that one that was odd you know i'm actually a joke what the flip was that that's uh that one that was odd you know i'm actually a joke what the was that probably it's just stupidities that i would never do that when i'm driving normally why am i nervous idiot oh my god i just don't understand my brain it's just the dumbest who i just entered the road on the right side who does that oh god [Music] okay if you can pull over and park up on the left hand side just anywhere along the left just on the road don't worry about the drives on this occasion okay but one okay i'm not one in one of those baits no just on the side of the road is fine anyway don't worry about the driveways for this one,750.0,823.68,827,187,SXsv4UuDerQ,1796,https://youtu.be/SXsv4UuDerQ?t=750,
okay thank you drive off whenever you're ready when parked up on a road with lots of park vehicles around you it's a good idea to indicate as there may be hazards that you can't see [Music] when we get to the end of this road turn right [Music],843.12,872.21,244,56,SXsv4UuDerQ,1796,https://youtu.be/SXsv4UuDerQ?t=843,

so [Music] do [Music] at the roundabout follow the road ahead adrian approaches his roundabout pretty confidently as he goes into the roundabout he curves around towards the left and uses his mirrors before signaling to exit and just follow the road ahead again [Music] the traffic lights turn right please to turn right at these traffic lights adrian should have kept his right signal running as pedestrians don't realize that he's turning right this could turn into a serious fault if somebody starts crossing the road on the right and they don't realize that you're turning from this point [Music] so right if you can pull over and park up on the left hand side of the road somewhere safe thank you that's great there drive off and if you're ready when moving off from stationary always remember to check your right blind spot again as a final check,957.36,1109.039,852,169,SXsv4UuDerQ,1796,https://youtu.be/SXsv4UuDerQ?t=957,

as we're driving down this road adrian gets too close to the car in front as they're not driving up to the speed of the road always maintain a good following distance from the traffic ahead it is 40 i don't know why we're doing 27. when we get to the roundabout term right,1187.28,1213.679,272,63,SXsv4UuDerQ,1796,https://youtu.be/SXsv4UuDerQ?t=1187,
[Music] approaching this traffic light junction we're turning left as it's a compulsory left turn but again a signal would be helpful for pedestrians that don't realize that the road only goes left [Music] let the roundabout turn right,1230.71,1270.32,235,47,SXsv4UuDerQ,1796,https://youtu.be/SXsv4UuDerQ?t=1230,
i kept thinking what that noise was but it's actually the little middle thing took pages to figure that out everyone says that when they're coming back doesn't that annoy you i like it my dad kept thinking as an indicator so he kept like flicking his indicator thinking that he left it on i kept thinking it was something rattling over there and at the end turn left screaming [Music],1302.08,1341.19,384,78,SXsv4UuDerQ,1796,https://youtu.be/SXsv4UuDerQ?t=1302,

do [Music] when overtaking cyclists always make sure that it's safe and necessary before you overtake make sure when you're overtaking that you leave at least one and a half meters of clearance from the cyclist when overtaking and don't move back towards the left suddenly after adrian does this really well and leaves enough clearance for the cyclist turn left,1396.32,1431.12,361,71,SXsv4UuDerQ,1796,https://youtu.be/SXsv4UuDerQ?t=1396,
[Music] you're gonna have to go left there mr thanks [Music] on these narrow residential roads it's really important to check your mirrors before you're signaling as cyclists will catch fine parking up if you can pull over and park up on the right hand side of the road please don't worry about the drives on this occasion [Music] actually let me go back [Music] thank you so i'd like you to reverse back now for about two car lengths keeping reasonably close to and parallel with the pavement as you carry out this exercise before starting to reverse adrian does look around checking his right and left blind spot but whilst reversing he's mostly using his right hand mirror and reversing in a straight line you need to keep checking both blind spots whilst you're reversing okay we've already done about a colin thank you and drive often if you're ready if you can just pull in and park up on the left hand side after this black car [Music],1451.17,1583.55,942,192,SXsv4UuDerQ,1796,https://youtu.be/SXsv4UuDerQ?t=1451,
okay that's great thank you you can switch off the engine all right that is the end of your driving test okay give me a few minutes okay okay okay okay doing that's the end of your driving test um unfortunately you wouldn't have passed on this occasion what how come well there's a few things you've done wrong actually oh my god the first one being the obvious one the roundabout yeah i told you to go left and then you thought you can't i don't know what happened you want to know i for some stupid reason thought it was a no entry road i i thought you tried to trick me you were like turn left right it doesn't it doesn't make any sense okay now by the time that you were about to miss the turn i thought oh shoot we're getting the wrong way and i thought okay and then you better slow it back yeah it's because i knew there was no one on my left yeah i know yeah so that way that you're entering the road from the,1596.4,1656.08,917,199,SXsv4UuDerQ,1796,https://youtu.be/SXsv4UuDerQ?t=1596,
wrong side yeah okay mirror checks to the left that i'm missing now i know you're checking your mirrors but you're not checking your mirrors before you're signaling before signaling yes so when i've told you to go left on a few occasions you kind of you can see the turning you slap on your signal and then when you get closer you're checking your mirrors before turning is that not okay you should be checking your mirrors and then signaling yeah um and lastly uh this is something i think this is for you recommended generally um following distance there are two separate occasions where we were driving on a 40 where the person in front is clearly not driving at 40 because of which we're now driving quite close to them aren't we okay and you said that you're like oh it's like 40 and this person's driving 27 and i was thinking this following distance is uh a bit risky really impatient yeah okay but yeah that's that okay cool um that's like four majors [Laughter],1657.36,1712.31,970,200,SXsv4UuDerQ,1796,https://youtu.be/SXsv4UuDerQ?t=1657,
oh there's a few sketchy ones in there but yeah that's about um minus mine is well we got five just on mirrors alone okay six seven first on two occasions when you were turning um right one was a traffic light and i think one was a left turn so when it's a compulsory left or a right turn like you're in position and that lanes only going a certain way you don't need signal you do need a signal you've not been signaling if if there's a left-only lane yeah you need to put a left signal yeah pedestrians oh they don't realize that that lane's left only but the point you did it out where i've marked it down one was a clear intersection where we were going right at traffic lights you signaled initially to get there and then you when you get there you switch off yeah yeah you should have had that signal running okay because if i'm over there and i'm trying to cross the road how do i know you're going that way yeah,1714.48,1762.72,919,197,SXsv4UuDerQ,1796,https://youtu.be/SXsv4UuDerQ?t=1714,
you don't yeah and then the other one was a compulsory left turn at traffic lights and again you're not saying you're not yeah i remember both of them yeah yeah okay so think of everyone that's been watching the video hopefully you can learn from some of adrian's mistakes now don't forget to like the video comment down below on how you thought adrian did today and don't forget to subscribe to the channel and subscribe to adrian's channel as well if you haven't already [Music],1764.559,1794.53,480,101,SXsv4UuDerQ,1796,https://youtu.be/SXsv4UuDerQ?t=1764,
[Music] hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving today i'm doing another driving lesson with my nephew lovejit now in today's lesson we're doing mock test style driving because he's actually got his driving test booked for about two weeks time now we've already been doing mock test driving for the last week or so um there were a few mistakes made but he's learnt from them which is good so we're just going to continue with that now for anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below what you think i've loved it's driving if he's making any mistakes and don't forget to subscribe to the channel if you haven't already alright so we're gonna do sort of 10 minute sessions so i'm going to get you to drive for 10 minutes where i'm just giving you instructions if you make any mistakes during that period i'm not going to say anything,5.97,58.16,875,185,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=5,
after the 10 minutes we're going to park up somewhere and then we'll talk about any mistakes if we need to correct them okay so the aim is to make sure you're driving safely okay it doesn't need to be a perfect drive even if you think you've made a mistake don't panic try and stay on top of it just try and forget it that's the best way okay all right whenever you're ready let's start the engine and drive off whenever you're ready,59.44,81.68,433,96,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=59,
all right at the end of the road turn on approach to this first junction logic forgets to use his mirrors and indicate for the turn he does look at the junction but this could have been an issue had a car been approaching from the distance at speed take the next road on your right,96.799,120.159,281,57,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=96,
[Music] ahead of us there is a crossroads where we are crossing the main road if you look in the middle of the road you can see a hazard line start to appear and just ahead of the hazard line you can see a giveaway line lovejit notices a road marking and slows down and stops behind the giveaway line to look both sides,139.28,157.04,319,68,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=139,
so at the end left,176.48,185.04,18,5,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=176,
this is a main road where the speed limit is 20 miles per hour so it's much more fuel efficient to be driving in third gear than it is to be driving in second gear it was foggy this morning but fog lights were not necessary as we could still see a hundred meters in the distance ahead all right on the roundabout i want you to follow some signs so once you follow signs towards rice slip in oxbridge [Music],205.28,238.13,407,88,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=205,
the last minor fault with use of mirrors before signaling wouldn't necessarily be a minor fault on this occasion as there was only one lane in the roundabout but as a new driver you should always be using your mirrors before indicating especially when you're leaving a big roundabout if lovejit had done this on a big roundabout where there are two lanes and he exits with no mirror check this would definitely be a minor but it could also be serious had somebody been trying to change lanes at that point,273.12,297.84,505,98,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=273,
[Music] it's a 20 speed limit yeah the speed limit on this road is 20 miles per hour it's painted on the road throughout and also signed on the side on either side throughout the road if there are no signs but street lamps that indicates that it's 30 miles per hour the speed on this road used to be 30 miles per hour which is why the sat nav still reads 30 but if the road says 20 then that's the new speed limit and that's what you need to stick to,314.22,344.72,450,106,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=314,
when passing a bus always pass slowly and watch out for pedestrians that may be crossing in front of the bus and use mirrors but no signal to come back into your side of the road all right so on the next roundabout we're not following rice lip anymore i want you to take the fourth exit towards harrow and northalt so fourth exit please [Music],368.319,401.91,344,72,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=368,
as lobster enters a roundabout he can go into lane three or four as his lane splits into two as soon as we enter the roundabout but in order to use lane three he needs to check his left mirror as vehicles from the left may straight line the roundabout just like this vehicle does here as we enter [Music] once you're in this lane you now need to follow the marking towards the left which is going to guide you outwards and spiral you into lane three lovejit nearly goes into the wrong lane but he checks his mirror and gets back into position [Music] this is a traffic light controlled spiral roundabout once in position you simply need to follow the markings and stay in your lanes the roundabout is gradually moving you outwards until your exit as lobjet had started the roundabout in the fourth lane the one that was closest to the roundabout as he's going around towards his exit his exit is now in the overtaking position,421.84,495.199,926,190,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=421,
take the next road on your left,518.399,518.399,31,7,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=518,
take the next road on your left [Music] uh with this serious fault logic did check his mirrors but his approach speed was too fast and he indicated too late causing the vehicles behind to suddenly slow down turn left and if you could just pull in and park up on the left here before the van just next to that tree just pass the tree actually okay thank you that's great all right brilliant have a little break now how's that last 10 minutes for you beginning was all right but then near the end i think i made a few mistakes okay would you say there were any serious mistakes uh when turning into this the the left road over here it was very slow wasn't it yeah you just needed to get the gear changing and be on your way there's a few mirror and signals or faults coming in then we had at the very beginning when we first started that left turn onto allenby road no mirror checks no signal left remember quite early on right at the,518.399,627.44,932,191,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=518,
beginning that first left turn you didn't signal for it yeah then there was um i'm just going over the main key points you know when you got into that roundabout when we were taking the fourth exit now as you've started you've gone for the right most lane which is fine once you've gone in that white line was kind of moving to the left you needed to keep with it you kind of veered off right towards greenford and then you checked left and you came back in so as soon as you've started at any roundabout and your your lane kind of goes round as it wraps around you need to follow the marking to the left because that's how you're going to spiral we've talked about that on that round but haven't we yeah okay um and then obviously once you came off that roundabout you're in the right hand lane which is the overtaking lane you were just happy happily driving in that lane weren't you should you not have gone back to the,628.64,676.72,922,198,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=628,
left lane yeah yeah you you did move back but that's because i said we're turning so you've moved back but you should be trying to get back and i know we had an issue with the lorry last lesson where you were trying to move back too early but once the road is straight speed up check your mirrors get back okay so a minor fault for that use of sorry minor fault full position no more driving on that one all right so we're going to go again so what are the points that you're going to be careful with this time around making sure i check mirrors signal each time yeah every time i turn yeah and speed limits the speed limits here and then also on roundabouts once you're in follow the marking to the left unless you know you want to go right then kind of if you're going like to the last exit or you're doing a u-turn then you would kind of wrap around again otherwise you'd spiral out okay yeah just start using more mirrors and,678.0,727.6,929,196,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=678,
then get that go changing for that small left turn okay so when you're ready we're gonna go again how does it feel when i'm sitting here in silence not saying anything scary that's the bit people find the most daunting because no one's saying anything and it's a bit well what's going on the examiner will make a bit of conversation but yeah don't get lost in conversation anyways that's me done now okay at the end of this row turn right and then right again,728.959,769.519,459,96,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=728,
okay now we're going to turn right and then left just without silver cars coming out so right and then left,791.839,795.2,107,22,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=791,
[Music],827.38,827.38,7,3,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=827,
okay if you could pull over and park on the right hand side of the road just behind this white car's fine don't worry about the drives on this occasion okay thank you good you don't need to switch off the engine though okay okay so what we're gonna do now is i'd like you to reverse back for about two car lengths keeping reasonably close to and parallel with the pavement as you carry out this exercise try not to touch the pavement,853.6,883.04,433,89,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=853,
thank you drive often if you're ready,913.04,913.04,37,8,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=913,
at the end of this road turn right,944.24,944.24,34,8,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=944,
the road that we're crossing is 40 miles per hour when the right hand side of the road clears up lobjet moves halfway into the junction and the traffic from the left gives way as the traffic in front is moving slower they're more likely to give way,959.759,972.0,248,52,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=959,
okay i'd like you to follow some signs now for a little while so i want you to follow signs towards heathrow [Music],990.24,1005.79,116,28,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=990,
the lane that we're in takes the second and the third exit but as we're going past 12 o'clock it's really important to have a right indicator on at this moment so that the vehicles behind realise what you're doing,1058.24,1068.0,213,46,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=1058,
loved it's driving nicely up to the speed of the road making sure to keep up with other traffic along this road at the next roundabout heathrow is signposted as the second exit which is the road ahead both lanes go ahead,1098.96,1110.559,220,48,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=1098,
as we enter the roundabout the white van is sticking out from the left and logic should have checked his mirrors towards the right before moving over he gets a minor fault for this,1129.52,1137.36,180,35,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=1129,
coming up to this roundabout we're turning right third exit and the right hand lane splits into two sections logic goes into the first half which should be the normal driving position towards the exit but as we went into the roundabout logic gets into the wrong lane which goes towards second exit as he enters the roundabout he moves towards the left too far going into the lane that's painted towards heathrow he realizes his fault and then carries on and takes the exit towards heathrow,1174.48,1202.4,489,96,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=1174,
going the wrong way is not a serious fault as long as you're driving safely according to the road markings in our last lesson lovejet made the same mistake on this roundabout where he got into the lane that goes towards heathrow when he realized he tried to change directions and suddenly moved into the lane that turns right causing a lorry to slow down and to use the horn,1218.24,1235.039,374,76,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=1218,
okay we're headed the wrong way so i'm just going to give you directions as normal okay just listen if you take the next exit just coming off here,1253.2,1259.6,146,31,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=1253,
so [Music] at the roundabout turn right please [Music],1284.32,1302.87,54,14,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=1284,
coming up to this sharp bend lovejit notices the slip road approaching he makes sure to speed up to the speed of the road so that he doesn't slow down any of the vehicles on the dual carriageway he matches the speed of the road as we're driving on the jill carriageway we take the exit towards the roundabout we loved it went the wrong way so we can repeat taking the third exit again,1345.12,1374.799,384,86,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=1345,
at this point logic should have been indicating right to make it clear that he's turning past 12 o'clock as he goes into the roundabout he gets into the correct lane to turn right [Music],1401.44,1413.67,187,41,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=1401,
as we move up from this position logic should now be aiming for the far left-hand lane in order to take the third exit he does use his mirrors but he doesn't move towards the left lane this could have been a serious fall had there been a car on his right as that car on the right would also be trying to move towards the left to take the third exit from this position lovejit has now got to change over from the fourth lane all the way towards the first lane to get into the normal driving position [Music] okay now the traffic lights turn left,1428.88,1471.6,544,113,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=1428,
if you can put it in park up on the left just by the tree that's great though thank you it's beautiful and just switch off the engine as well thank you how that second okay would you say there were any serious thoughts in that one i didn't say serious thoughts um i got a bit confused on the roundabout and i had to go the wrong way yeah so that you dealt with that nicely you got into the lane for heathrow and then you knew you couldn't go right from there because it would have been dangerous for others around and you dealt with that really safely by just carrying on to heathrow that was great i'm really happy with that um but when you did that roundabout again the second time round i didn't love it just purely for the second half so you started at the correct point you're going around you went halfway through you're in the correct lane now the two lanes on your left at that point were going straight weren't they,1531.679,1595.44,924,195,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=1531,
which means your lane and the lane on your right can go right as you've moved off you've signaled right you're moving around you're checking the mirrors but then you've just carried on and you've cut back into the third lane what about the person on your right that would be turning right where are they going to go if you've taken the third lane so you know you're going around right yeah there are two lanes that turn right okay you're like two two round one yeah so you're waiting in the roundabout and there are two lanes turning right you're in the first of the two and there's a lane on your right as you go around there are four lanes as you've gone round you're checking mirrors to the left there's nobody on your left you've made sure it's clear but you've gone round but you've stayed on the third because i was supposed to go into the second one first first yeah because now the person next to you they're also,1597.279,1645.919,921,196,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=1597,
going right there you're kind of leaving them in the fourth lane which no longer exits so you're checking left but you're staying right so you very easily could have had a serious fault there because you're not checking the right to stay right you should have checked the left like you did and then moved into the left and move left you know you're leaving okay remember you always want to move back to the left at the penultimate so you you could see that was second exit so check the mirror move over and then you can exit because when you exit and i said turn left you had to jump over by about four lanes yeah you wouldn't have to done sorry you wouldn't have had to do that if you were already on the left so every time you're leaving a roundabout you need to try and move back to the left if you've got the option all right okay all right so there were no serious faults there were no serious faults but that that one at the end where you've,1647.76,1692.32,947,198,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=1647,
got back into the third lane could have very easily gone serious had somebody been on your right yeah the right was empty the whole time so you kind of got away with it but it's it's not great okay so you need to be alert even if you're staying right you should check right because you were busy checking left but staying right does that make sense so let's talk about the the lane changes and the slip roads remember how we've talked about leaning forward yeah yeah you're kind of just using the mirrors and the blind spot's quite big i need you to really make the most of that seat rather than having to just sit back and so you don't have to look back like that or you know at high speeds i wouldn't suggest it i'd rather you kind of lean forward use the mirrors because it opens your blind spot anyways and when you're in that position you can see a lot more to the right and then if you wanted to you can always just glance,1693.679,1737.2,928,194,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=1693,
over but you don't want to turn around at high speeds you don't really want to you can use the mirrors to kind of help help okay so that's the end of your driving lesson today we are going to go back to practice that roundabout again so you can have another attempt but remember just try and make your way left you're checking you just need to move over now okay but how did that feel doing that mock test kind of dry scary scary is it because you know oh i think i'm making a mistake or you're thinking wait how's it going no it's like when i feel like i've made a mistake but you don't see it yeah and then i just know you're having to analyze everything yourself really yeah on the go but no it's definitely an improvement from the first one to the second one as you can see so we're gonna keep this going now until the test okay we're definitely looking to do more of a mock test drive next lesson the whole thing okay,1739.2,1791.2,922,199,sKjGAQXvoxo,1813,https://youtu.be/sKjGAQXvoxo?t=1739,

nice [Music] hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving my name is aman and today i'm doing a mock test with jake now this is his first mock test yeah yeah um his driving test is coming up in about three days time oh my god yeah so he's been doing lessons with me for maybe maybe six weeks or so so we've done about 10 hours in total but um you did do lessons with another instructor before that did i do okay um so in the mock test today um do you want me to tell you a little bit about the test yeah yes okay so throughout the drive i want you to follow the road ahead whenever i need you to turn i will tell you in plenty of time if i don't say anything keep going straight if you're not sure where you're going you can always ask cool okay yeah but i am going to give you a little bit of independent driving in that as well i'm going to give you a series of directions,5.04,65.199,875,196,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=5,
to follow at some point cool we're going to do one maneuver and we may also carry out the emergency stop so for anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe to the channel if you haven't already now we're gonna get straight into it you ready i'm ready okay so i'm gonna ask a quick question before we get driving yeah could you tell me where would you find the information for the recommended tire pressure and how do you check this uh search up on youtube or something if you don't know yeah but other than that yeah that's all that's the answer i give so i've got no clue okay probably search up online okay that's fine [Laughter] so whenever you're ready let's get started it's not there is that jake i'm going to give you a second to restart you know your engine's not on right what yeah give me a second one second don't start just yet none of that was gonna work because your,66.799,131.76,933,201,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=66,
engine's not on i thought i thought i turned it on no we didn't remember the engine's not on we put the ignition oh yeah right okay okay so you ready it's ready i'm ready now okay when you're ready start driving yeah that feels more alive doesn't it it's a great start what else do you just stalled there's an m1 it is yeah it was just too quick okay now we start okay jake gets a minor fault for moving off safety as he did not check his right blind spot again had somebody been in that right blind spot this could have gone down into a serious fault,132.879,186.319,551,122,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=132,
if you can pull over and park up on the left somewhere safe cool sorry i just don't want you to park too close yeah cool thank you driver movie already,242.879,261.6,151,32,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=242,
at the roundabout turn left,287.6,287.6,27,6,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=287,
jake makes really good progress down these roads making sure to drive up to the speed of the road whenever it's safe the speed on most of these roads is 20 miles per hour but on the sat nav it reads 30. always drive at the speed that you can see on the road there will be signs painted or there'll be signs on either side every now and then jake is driving slightly over the speed at points which gives him a minor fault for speeding [Music] at the roundabout turn left [Music] always slow down when you're passing along a road with parked vehicles on both sides and oncoming traffic jake slows down really well remember the phrase the smaller the gap the slower you go you can pull over and park up on the left hand side anywhere along here don't worry about the drives on this occasion sounds great thank you okay so what we're going to do now is we're going to start the independent driving so i'd like you to,337.44,431.599,912,195,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=337,
go down this road when you get to the roundabout take the fourth exit cool okay and then from there i'm going to get you to follow some signs but i'll tell you shortly after okay [Music],433.199,445.19,186,42,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=433,
uh [Music],462.319,475.43,10,4,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=462,
so,553.04,553.04,2,1,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=553,
[Music] jake does around about perfectly making sure to move towards the left hand lane as he's passing the second exit he did do the roundabout a little bit too quickly so it's a good idea to take it carefully in case somebody was on the left hand side,573.11,590.48,253,55,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=573,
[Music],605.73,605.73,7,3,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=605,
so you're still following signs stains is signed posted as the second exit on this roundabout both lanes go straight on this dual carriageway as we're going forward jake gets a minor fault for signal necessary as he signals right to move into the middle lane [Music] jake was initially slowing down for the traffic lights and he should have stopped when the light started changing as he went into the roundabout he straight lines and goes into the right hand lane and then checks his mirrors and comes back into the left now nobody was on the right at this point but this would be a serious fault as he did not check his mirrors to the right before moving right that'll be the end of your independent driving i'm going to give you directions as normal from now on all right we're going to take the exit coming off here when leaving a dual carriageway from a slip road always make sure to indicate in good time as we're traveling at 40,622.8,707.12,934,193,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=622,
miles per hour you want to indicate at least about 200 yards before the exit at the roundabout we're gonna turn right it's fourth,709.2,718.16,129,29,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=709,
jake does this roundabout really well making sure to stay in the right hand lane up until we're passing the third exit he starts using his mirrors and indicates as he's passing the third exit island in order to take the fourth exit [Music],749.68,767.96,239,50,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=749,
at the traffic light junction turn right this traffic light is a pedestrian crossing and you can tell this because of the zigzag lines on the floor at junctions you don't find zigzag lines like this it's just the next one up there [Music] this right turn at the traffic lights is a near side turn so you need to wait in the middle until you can see the road ahead is clear or you have a safe gap to turn without slowing down oncoming traffic the gap that jake takes is a little bit risky as the vehicle in front would definitely have to step off the accelerator as we turned across their path [Music] jake deals with the hazard head really well making sure to stop at a good distance and selects first gear as he stops,787.68,861.04,718,151,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=787,
as we're going forward the speed on this new road is now 20 miles per hour jake does realize that the speed has changed but he's still going over the speed limit at times at this point jake starts driving 26 miles per hour in a 20 zone he only slowed down as he saw a speed sign ahead flashing his speed that it was over the speed limit [Music] okay when it's safe to do so i'd like you to demonstrate how you would do miss the front windscreen [Music] i think you can turn that off [Music],878.639,943.93,490,115,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=878,
take the next road on your right please the road we're turning into is a one-way road you can see this with the white line painted across on the entry and the one-way signs on either side jake takes the turn a little bit wide jake notices the obstruction ahead really early and make sure to slow down and select first gear for better control we're going ahead from here,970.959,1018.32,369,76,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=970,
nice stalling is not a big issue as long as you recover from it very quickly and jake makes sure to recover and also checks the road for safety,1056.799,1063.84,143,31,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=1056,
[Music],1086.48,1086.48,7,3,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=1086,
you can take the next road on your right please [Music],1107.44,1110.75,55,13,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=1107,
at the end of the road so right peace [Music],1135.12,1138.72,45,12,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=1135,
jake has a really nice approach to this next sharp bend making sure to position towards the left in case of oncoming traffic if you can pull over and park on the right hand side of the road don't worry about the drives on this occasion just anywhere along the right is fine [Music] thank you okay what i'd like you to do now jake is to reverse back for about two car lengths keeping reasonably close and parallel with the pavement as you carry out this exercise and try not to touch the pavement cool jake does this reversing exercise really well making sure to keep the cast slow while looking over his left and right blind spot as he's reversing thank you drive often if you're ready when you're moving off from this part position it's really important to check your left blind spot thoroughly as you're moving across from the opposite side of the road and somebody may be parked in your blind spot about to move at the same time if you could pull in a park just behind,1171.76,1259.28,971,196,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=1171,
this white car just to move her along here [Music] that's great though thank you secure the car and switch off the engine thank you just give me a few moments okay so how was the drive for you i think it most of it went all right but when i did make a mistake it was probably like a pretty big one like maybe do you think there wasn't a dollar three times or i think i went a bit faster on one of the roundabouts that's for sure yeah but other than that i think it went all right okay the drive overall you know what you're doing but there's a few bits where you were a little bit hasty which is where the mistake came in okay like you're saying that round about where you were going a bit quick that traffic light was changing yeah i kind of like i made a decision then i was like oh no i'm gonna cut i'm gonna go through it yeah because your initial reaction was to slow down when you saw the lights,1260.72,1321.919,901,197,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=1260,
changing and then you i kind of got to it and i was like uh maybe i can make it through yeah so unfortunately for me that traffic light was a big issue because you were slowing down and then all of a sudden you've just gone through it yeah so firstly that traffic light and immediately after we've had another fault because you're now skipping that light and you're kind of trying to get through quickly as you've gone into the roundabout you've straight-lined what's that so you know when you from your lane you were supposed to go in and go round oh i'll just go straight into the other lane yeah you've just gone straight through the other lane because the other car didn't come through you were okay yeah yeah but it was just what one led to another yeah yeah that was all a bit messy that particular roundabout okay all the other roundabouts she did really well it was just that one okay and would have that would that have been like a,1323.2,1366.159,940,193,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=1323,
major one i've got three majors yeah two of them being on that roundabout yeah and the other one being your use of speed how many times did you go over 20 yeah i think quite a few times yeah and sometimes i kind of like thought it was a 30 and it was probably a 20. that's where your serious fault came in because it was that initial it was this one road where we were on a 30 and then it went to 20 and now you're going 26 and then the little smiley on the side yeah i tried i saw the smiley thing and i think did i slow down when i saw it so i didn't want to make it upset but yeah i did so yeah that's where your serious fault came in on that road because you went 26 miles per hour on a 20 yeah but there were various other occasions where you were trickling over 20 and it wasn't even like a little bit it was just like constant yeah and it was just,1367.6,1409.6,854,203,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=1367,
like okay well this is this is not good yeah fair enough okay but besides that i want to talk about um the stalling what happened i don't know i just feel like there's pressure whenever there's like a test kind of thing i always do mistakes like that i knew i was going to stall today but yeah i don't i don't know how i stalled like what three or two i've been twice twice yeah twice so the first one was right at the beginning as you tried to set away were you nervous when we started yeah i don't like test conditions so i think i generally think that was like part of nerves or something yeah that's what i did usually that's why i didn't say anything about it i just thought okay let me just let him carry on with it yeah yeah and the one out there was just messy you you kind of saw the gap before the learner in the orangey car yeah you're about to take it and you,1411.84,1454.64,871,191,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=1411,
hesitated as well on that one yeah it was my bad judgment of their speed yeah i thought it was going faster than it was i probably couldn't they were going 20 on a 20. yeah they're getting the right speed so yeah and besides that let's talk about that fall right at the beginning um with your not fault exactly i don't want to say fault you know right at the beginning when i said how do you check the recommended tire pressure you know where'd you find the information and you went youtube no i've got no idea that's what i do though but you know but um yeah you'll find it in the vehicle handbook or on the side of your door on the on the petrol cap i mean yeah the vehicle handbook makes more sense in youtube but yeah you could probably get away with that you'll probably find it there too but yeah yeah it would make more sense so i'm just like the handbook yeah okay that doesn't make more sense but yeah it's mostly just that speed that i,1455.84,1500.0,945,203,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=1455,
kept thinking you were going a little bit quick in places um i just need to look at like actually open my eyes to signs and stuff you did do really well with that maneuver that maneuver back there was really good you know reversing that yeah observation control brilliant and even when we came around that really sharp corner back there yeah you came into it really nice and that black car was coming yeah there's a lot of good bits but it's the little bad bits are big rough bits that we need to kind of just straighten out a bit more yeah okay all right so that's the end of our video today hopefully that was insightful and useful to everybody else outside as well but as it's your first mock test you know you've made a few mistakes that's right yeah but it's okay it's how you learn from this yeah exactly okay so in the next mock test you'll definitely do a lot better than this we'll have none of these serious faults anyways no yeah we won't,1502.64,1551.52,949,195,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=1502,
all right thank you for watching hopefully that video was useful don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe to the channel bye [Music],1552.88,1561.48,155,30,awerX7TEcEo,1563,https://youtu.be/awerX7TEcEo?t=1552,
i'm sorry [Music] hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving my name is aman and today i'm doing a mock test with sarah now this is the first time we're driving together you've got your test in about just over two weeks time yeah yeah um she's never done a mock test so this is her first ever mock test yes okay um yeah we've been through a little bit about what the test is going to be about and we've had a little drive already so you're familiar with the car yeah okay now i'm going to tell you a little bit about the test so throughout the drive i want you to follow the road ahead whenever i need you to turn i will tell you in plenty of time if i don't say anything keep going straight if you're not sure where you're going you can always ask okay i'm gonna get you to do one maneuver and an emergency stop possibly but it's everything that you've already,2.48,61.12,864,192,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=2,
been practicing with your instructor yep okay for anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe to the channel if you haven't already so we're gonna get started now all right so before we get started can i ask a quick question um could you tell me where do you find the information for your recommended tire pressure and how do you check this so that'll be in the manufacturers or the vehicle handbook okay and you would use a reliable pressure gauge and you would check when the clothes are cold okay brilliant that sounds good okay so whenever you're ready let's start the engine and then we'll get driving,62.399,96.799,659,129,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=62,
[Music] take the next road on your right please sara does have a bit of a habit of just letting go of the steering wheel and letting it slide back to the straight point now this isn't necessarily a fault but you should always guide the steering wheel back so that you've got full control over your steering [Music] with some of these junctions sarah does look both ways but we can't quite fully see both sides of the road so it would have been a better idea to stop look and then continue in case somebody was approaching [Music] turn right when approaching a stop junction it's really important to stop completely before you go over the line it's a stop junction as we cannot see on the main road and our view is obscured because of the angle of the turn sara is mainly looking towards the right and ahead she does look left but she looks quite late now this could have been an issue had somebody been approaching [Music],141.64,230.99,922,190,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=141,
when driving down residential roads with lots of parked vehicles always watch out for large oncoming vehicles with meeting situations and try to give way early [Music] and take the next road on your left [Music] merging left out of this junction sarah gets marked down for junction observation because she's not looking left as she's moving forward which also affects her steering as she comes out of the turn always look right left right at least once before you emerge over the giveaway line and try to follow the corner around which would have made the turn a lot easier rather than a sharp steer by going forward and then turning [Music] the black car head is trying to do a parallel park always make sure to leave at least two car lengths from the vehicle that's reversing to give them plenty of clearance now here is a really good example of why you should always check your mirrors as this motorbike turned up out of nowhere and didn't wait around had we not checked the mirrors this could have been an issue [Music],238.959,338.92,1023,200,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=238,
when driving down a high street always keep scanning both sides of the road in between the parked cars in case someone may step into the road or open the door as you're driving through as there's a higher chance of a hazard developing on a high street than on an average road we're gonna as we enter the roundabout sarah loses a bit of control over the steering wheel she starts using her mirrors and signaling to exit the roundabout but she's not looking where she's going [Music] but the roundabout turn right please okay [Music] it's the third exit [Music],347.759,402.72,559,118,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=347,
following the road ahead [Music] as we got to the next roundabout sarah goes over the giveaway line and then stops the car this could have been a serious fault had we entered the roundabout enough to disturb the flow of the traffic [Music] as we're going forward the road opens up into two lanes and both of these lanes are going ahead zara goes into the overtaking lane you should always try and get into the left-hand lane if both lanes are going ahead only use the right lane when turning right or overtaking the next set of traffic lights we're going to turn left [Music],429.28,496.78,575,122,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=429,
we're currently on a 40 miles per hour slip road to join a dual carriageway sara is making really slow progress and only gets up to about 26 27 miles per hour before joining you should always indicate when joining from a slip road as you need to bring it to their attention that you're joining from this angle even though you can't go anywhere else by the end of the slip road you need to use the signal to alert others of your presence,528.0,549.92,436,95,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=528,
okay we're going to be taking the exit coming off towards greenfield which is in 300 yards driving on a 40 miles per hour road aimed to indicate about 200 yards before the exit making it very clear you're leaving sara indicates very late just as she's taking the exit okay when we get to the roundabout we're just following the road ahead second exit [Music],566.48,604.33,358,78,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=566,
and then if you can turn the left in here [Music] as we're going down this road sarah does get a serious fault with the parked van on the left-hand side her attention goes on to the right hand side where she's turning and i had to take control take the next road on your right please [Music] sorry [Music] sorry,647.76,690.24,311,71,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=647,
[Music],707.92,707.92,7,3,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=707,
so [Music] as we moved off from this position and we're moving off on an uphill gradient sarah started changing gears a bit too early and the car was struggling with second gear you should always change gears later on an uphill gradient,724.56,748.079,236,47,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=724,
[Music] turning right at this roundabout you have to drive over the roundabout a little bit as there's not enough space to go fully around it the new road is on a downhill gradient sarah should have kept her foot over the brake in order to avoid picking up speed as she turns in [Music] driving down this road to deal with the meeting situation sarah doesn't slow down enough and gets way too close to the black car on the opposite side of the road,763.44,807.839,448,96,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=763,
if you can pull over and park up on the left thank you drive often if you're ready,831.44,846.079,82,19,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=831,
turning right from here,870.959,870.959,23,5,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=870,
[Music] so,898.11,906.399,10,4,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=898,
[Music],925.81,925.81,7,3,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=925,
and take the next road on your left [Music],944.0,948.72,43,11,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=944,
at the end time left,972.8,972.8,20,5,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=972,
as we're waiting to emerge the driver on the right hand side has started waiting for zara and he's giving away she realizes a bit too slowly when they give way look both ways and watch out for motorbikes that may be overtaking [Music] driving down this road there is now a bus lane on the left-hand lane the road marking is slightly faded but we were outside of the bus lane operation hours so we were allowed to use the bus lane sarah is not 100 in the bus lane at this point so she's kind of obstructing the vehicle behind from being able to overtake [Music],1003.92,1055.84,560,124,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=1003,
as we've moved off from this position sarah should have checked her mirrors towards the left before moving left as cyclists and motorbikes may still pass on her left as she's in between the two lanes [Music],1094.559,1109.41,207,44,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=1094,
the two lanes are starting to merge in the distance when merging you should always go right up to the point of merge and it should be one car from each lane sarah is a little bit too cautious and vehicles from the right hand lane keep going ahead you should slowly keep moving up until the point of merge and the lane on the right will start to give way if they don't give way then you should drop back and the next car should give way just up ahead sarah gets a serious fault for response to road markings she initially stops before the keep clear but then moves forward and waits fully on the keep clear junction the keep clear box is for the vehicles from the right hand side to be able to enter if there's traffic on this road,1137.28,1186.72,730,148,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=1137,
[Music],1203.74,1203.74,7,3,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=1203,
sarah deals with the pedestrian really well by stopping in good time but once the pedestrians out of the road she should have checked her mirrors and moved around and overtaken the bus the bus driver behind us had to use the horn at this point we should have gone around the bus as it was safe to do so [Music],1223.2,1245.0,310,65,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=1223,
you can take the next road on your left [Music] just in here we're turning in here [Music] okay just keep following the road ahead i'm gonna direct you normally from here if you can turn right in here okay now sarah what i'd like you to do is to forward park into any of the spaces on your right just make sure to finish within the white lines please,1274.88,1317.36,350,78,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=1274,
you happy to leave it there okay thank you just reverse out the space whenever you're ready to rest towards the right we're gonna head out that way when carrying out any form of parking once you've secured the car it's a good idea to check by opening the door to see how much space you have on your side and with that you'll get an idea of how much space you have on the opposite side when the examiner usually asks are you happy to leave it there if you're unsure it's best to readjust the left hand tyre was actually over the line,1365.2,1409.2,532,113,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=1365,

okay if you can pull in and park up on the left just before the next park car [Music] just in that space before that tree because it's growing out a little bit that's brilliant thank you secure the car and you can switch off the engine as well okay just turn off the indicator all right that's the end of your test give me a few minutes how was the drive no not great all right so any serious faults definitely uh definitely what do you think they were um i think the first one was at the junction and i was turning left what happened when you turned a left um there was a car i don't really see it so that that didn't go down as a serious fault but yeah there was a bit of a habitual fault coming out at that point so your steering was so wide yeah you wish you should have been turning earlier um and also you were mainly paying attention to the right there weren't you yeah so when you came out,1533.36,1596.32,897,190,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=1533,
there you were looking right and your steering was going out you stopped in time so it was kind of dealt with but it did go down as a minor on that one but yeah that shouldn't have been happening of course um there's another there's some other faults i want to go over the first one being one of the obvious ones where i had to grab the wheel yeah so we're coming up to this point where there was a right turn i said turn right you're looking where you're going now there's a large fern part did you realize how close she got yeah i at the end i tried to write five obviously you interference yeah it's just going so close that i couldn't let it go any further okay so that that did go down as a serious fault on that one um there's another one afterwards which is a bit silly road markings we were down on greenford high street we're going up to the traffic lights there's a bit of a queue in front of you and then there's a,1598.24,1641.12,925,201,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=1598,
keep clear box did i stay in the club you went onto the keep clear at first you were just sort of front tires overhanging kind of nearly in and then as you're waiting you just moved fully onto the keep clear yeah and then the last one being your parallel your bay park just now sorry you were not in the bay well your turning point at the beginning was fine you turned in at the correct point but you straightened up too early like you know what you're doing but it's just um sometimes i'm trying to think of where the main points are for you here yeah you know what you're doing but it's just a matter of when the road was getting a little bit tighter you should have gone slower select lower gear um but then once the road clears up get up to the speed mostly just work on that hesitation i think you know with mainly with the bosses near the end if it's safe just use your mirrors go and if it's if the lanes are merging don't,1642.48,1701.919,929,198,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=1642,
keep waiting for them to give way to you you've got to go forward because if they see that you've waited they're just going to keep going because when you're merging you should merge and turn yeah yeah i know they kept coming in but that's because you're waiting they're just gonna keep going and besides that just sort out some of that progress and hesitation early on you know when we had a stop junction yeah when you got to the end of that you were looking right and ahead but i didn't feel like you were looking left all right okay and you kind of went you're looking like as if you're really shy to look this way and that's exactly where the issue with the silver car happened just soon after that oh yeah of course you got to the end of the road and you went like this and then you just go in and then he's turned up so you need to kind of be okay well i'm looking a bit more flexible okay all right so how was your mock test,1702.799,1752.72,932,200,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=1702,
experience today well it's a good experience it's definitely good to get some practice in but um yeah i need to work on some faults so you know where your weak areas are a little bit yeah and how was it um knowing that you've made a mistake and we're not talking it through it was difficult because obviously in a real exam they either just take your call yeah but at that point you'd still have to carry on driving safe because at that point you can't go oh god great it failed it's about having a good attitude carry on driving which you carried on with which was good just your thinking feeling knowing that you do now will rectify that yeah but no you did carry on which is good but yeah just tidy some of that up and you'll be fine for your test okay all right so that's the end of a mock test today um think of everyone that's been watching don't forget to like the video comment and subscribe thank you for watching bye [Music],1754.64,1802.92,934,196,2DndkFipkVA,1805,https://youtu.be/2DndkFipkVA?t=1754,
[Music] hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving today i'm doing another mock test with my nephew lovejir now his driving test is in a few days time so today we're doing the test at the time of his actual driving test if you guys enjoy watching these videos don't forget to give it a thumbs up comment down below and subscribe to the channel if you haven't already okay so before we get started could you tell me where would you find the information for the recommended tire pressure and how do you check this um it's going to be in the vehicle handbook or on the side of the tanks it says okay and how do you check this the tie brushes it should stay on the side of the tail okay that's fine all right so whenever you're ready we're going to get started to start the engine and we're just going to follow the satnav from here so whenever you're ready we're going to go up to the end,8.55,69.04,888,191,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=8,
and turn right and the satnav should start from there,70.32,71.84,53,11,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=70,
[Music] so we're turning right from here okay,91.03,93.2,45,11,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=91,
on this right turn logic make sure to do a really wide turn turning into the left hand side of the new road leading into this next bend we have part vehicles on the right hand side and the yellow van approaching lovelet's in a really good position which allows the center of the road for the oncoming traffic after 80 yards go left on the roundabout and take the first exit go left on the roundabout and take the first exit along this road there are various meeting situations with oncoming traffic lobjet makes sure to drive really slowly allowing enough clearance all around his vehicle [Music] driving along on a road like this with parked cars on either side on the average road you can only fit one car in the middle of the road so aim to position the center of the road along your left shoulder that way the center of the car is in the center of the road if you can fall over and park up on the left somewhere safe,114.64,195.36,920,187,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=114,

so [Music] turn left b455 then take the second right going up to the end of this road logic goes around into the left-hand corner which gives him a good position to turn into the new road just ahead of us on the left there is a cyclist ahead before overtaking a cyclist always make sure that it's safe and necessary never overtake on a bend near junctions or when you're approaching the brava hill lobjet should have tried to leave a bit more clearance from this cyclist turn right [Music],231.519,303.34,489,104,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=231,

coming up to this next round about to turn right logic gets a fault for response to road markings now the turn we're taking is quite a sharp right turn so naturally as you take this turn the right side tires go over the roundabout but lovejet went over the roundabout with all four tyres due to the nature of this turn as it's quite a sharp turn it's really quite difficult to avoid the roundabout but loved it should have tried to make a bit more of an effort to go around it go right on the roundabout and take the second exit then bear right [Music] bear right then turn left [Music],443.68,497.0,586,126,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=443,
after 80 yards turn left a 41-27 turn left lobjet makes the most of the open view onto the new road making sure to look carefully and continue without hesitation [Music] after 300 yards cross the roundabout and take the second exit [Music] loved it approaches around about really well starting in the left hand lane to follow the road ahead second exit cross the roundabout and take the second exit,512.479,561.92,398,83,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=512,
as lobster enters this roundabout he makes sure to keep his position over towards the far left he's checking all his mirrors to see what's happening in his surroundings keeping in the left-hand lane as he reaches the first island he signals left to take the second exit take the exit a4127 then take the second right [Music],579.36,603.48,324,66,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=579,
after 150 yards turn right then take the second left [Music] turn right then take the second left when approaching a right turn try to position your vehicle more in the middle of the road over the hatched area so that the traffic behind is not affected when you're waiting to turn right [Music] turn left,634.72,683.36,304,63,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=634,
if you can pull over and pop up on the left just before this white car don't worry about the drives on this occasion just about there it's fine at the end of the road turn left okay so what we're gonna do now using the vehicle in front i'd like you to carry out the parallel park exercise so start alongside the vehicle in the road then reverse back and finish within two car lengths and try not to touch the pavement as you do this,713.04,740.32,432,91,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=713,
so,780.079,780.079,2,1,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=780,
once you've completed the maneuver you should secure the car by turning on the handbrake and going into neutral lovejit decides to then adjust his maneuver his front left tyre touches the pavement and he also did not look around before starting to go forward thank you drive open if you're ready,796.16,811.2,295,57,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=796,
so back to following the site lab again turn left,837.519,843.519,49,10,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=837,

[Music] after 300 yards go right on the roundabout and take the third exit towards oxford going up to this round about to take the third exit you can use the middle or the far right lane to turn right logic goes for the middle lane to turn right as we enter the roundabout he starts cutting into the left hand lane a little bit which causes the lorry behind us to have to slow down and to use the horn to make us aware of his presence as we enter the roundabout logic needed to go into the roundabout a bit further take the middle lane in order to avoid cutting into the left-hand edge third exit towards oxford [Music],913.99,959.89,619,134,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=913,
take the exit then turn left [Music] turn left towards old field lane south then turn right approaching this next road on the right the first road on the right is actually a no entry logic goes forward and starts positioning as if he's going to turn into that road he realizes very quickly and moves forward had he waited any longer this would have been a serious fault turn right,1008.88,1064.08,380,74,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=1008,
[Music] cross the roundabout and take the second exit [Music],1084.85,1106.03,61,15,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=1084,
if you can pull over and park up on the left-hand side just behind the black car,1131.36,1132.72,80,18,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=1131,
okay that'll be the end of your independent driving i'm going to give you directions as normal from now on okay okay drive off and if you're ready,1147.919,1153.679,146,31,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=1147,
[Music] with meeting traffic on roads like this try and identify oncoming traffic as early as possible and then look to meet somewhere along the middle of the road so that you're both traveling into the space lovejet deals with all the meeting situations really well leaving a good clearance all around his vehicle take the next road on your left please,1180.05,1215.12,353,67,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=1180,
so [Music] loved it should have tried to deal with this oncoming van a little bit earlier as he has to go into a really small space in order to get out of the van's path he does so really well but try and give way in bigger gaps that you have more space to maneuver through,1241.679,1267.6,273,61,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=1241,
so,1295.84,1295.84,2,1,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=1295,
turn right at the end [Music],1330.08,1336.36,29,8,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=1330,
and [Music],1393.36,1395.51,11,4,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=1393,
okay if you can keep going a bit further and then if you can pull and park up on the left just before the speed ramp but on this road okay just on the road not on the pavement that's great though thank you stop there and secure the car and switch off the engine as well thank you just give me a few minutes all right that is the end of your driving test how was your drive lobby i think it was good yeah would you say that there were any concerns at all okay now unfortunately it wouldn't be a pass on this occasion okay and that's due to one major fault that you had and that was on that roundabout greenfield roundabout when we had to do it the second time around and you were turning right weren't you yeah now you chose to go into the middle lane as you went into the roundabout the lights were changing but that wasn't even the issue as you're going into the roundabout there's a bit of a lane discipline issue,1410.559,1467.039,915,195,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=1410,
so you're in the middle lane as you're entering you're kind of cutting back in towards the left you didn't exactly enter into their lane but you're just you're so close you're sorry you're so close that the lorry driver the skip driver behind he he was having to slow down for you whereas the right hand side of the road was empty so you needed to just go in more and then go around you kind of started going around quite quickly which is why the left lane was being cut off do you remember hearing a hoot on that roundabout a little bit yeah and that's quite similar to a fault that we had a few lessons back remember when we had that big lorry behind us and you came off a dual carriageway in the right lane same thing you're just cause you're going round towards like a left bend let's say you're kind of just cutting it a bit too early okay so there is a bit of a,1469.12,1512.84,867,193,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=1469,
pattern there so i want to talk about road marking because it was two separate occasions with road markings you're not positioning properly the first one was quite a heavy minor fault which was your roundabout right turn so the roundabout was quite a sharp right and you kind of have to go over the roundabout but i felt like you went over it a lot more than you needed to remember that one there was like a prius in front of us at the time yeah yeah so you needed to try to come round to the left and then turn so the right side tires can go over but not the left you went all four it was really heavy because of the shape and because of the angle of the turn you couldn't exactly avoid going over the roundabout so that's why i was like yeah so it's mainly just that lorry issue that was that was really what got it for you besides that it was a good drive just a few minor things here and there but we'll talk about those now okay,1515.039,1563.12,933,199,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=1515,
all right the roundabout itself was good it was it was literally just that bit where the lorry was now having to slow down for you did you notice i had to kind of put my hand up like this a little bit did you think wait did i do something wrong yeah confused yeah it's purely because when i looked over he was looking at me giving me evils and i was like ah sorry mate and you realize you're a learner at this point that still you know there's tons of space use your lane properly okay all right so that's the end of our mock test today hopefully some of that information has been useful for you guys and thank you for everyone that's been watching [Music],1566.88,1605.81,656,139,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=1566,

hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving today i'm doing a mock test with eva now she's been doing lessons with me from a complete beginner which we started back in 2019 coming up to three years now but the lessons have been very spaced out there was a long break that we had in between and um she's got her tests coming up in just two days time so this is her first official mock test we've been doing a little bit of driving here and there where we're kind of mock test style 10 minutes 15 minutes but today going for the whole thing yeah so yeah we're gonna see how she does um and then hopefully from there we'll be able to work on any areas if there are any hoping for a nice pass here but yeah let's get started you want me to tell you a little bit about the test um okay so throughout the drive i want you to follow the road ahead whenever i need you to turn i will tell you in plenty of,21.119,69.119,899,198,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=21,
time if i don't say anything you're going to keep going straight if you're not sure where you're going i want you to just ask but i will be telling you in good time okay so we're going to do one maneuver and we may also carry out the emergency stop yeah everything we've already been practicing okay now we're going to do 20 minutes of independent driving which will be on the sat now which i'm going to start from here so i want you to just follow the sat nav so for anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe to the channel if you haven't already now we're just going to get straight into it but before we get started i'm going to ask a quick question could you tell me how would you check that your headdress is correctly adjusted uh so i'd make sure that it's my eyes slash like top of my ears or in the center okay and then uh the hard,70.88,112.079,894,195,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=70,
back of it should be as close to my to the back of my head as is comfortable okay that's fine that's fine all right so we're gonna get started now so when you're ready you can start the engine it's brilliant i'm just going to get the satellite and make sure it's up now so whenever you're ready here i'd like you to drive off from here and just go straight down this road,115.68,138.8,371,84,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=115,
after 100 yards across the roundabout on approach to this pedestrian ahead it wasn't necessary to stop for him as he was waiting in the middle but it wasn't an issue as we were slow enough to be able to stop as we were already slowing for the roundabout,156.64,168.72,253,54,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=156,

cross the roundabout and take the second exit on approach to this cyclist ahead eva decides to overtake before the gradient now there was enough time but she should have tried to leave enough clearance from the cyclist before moving back in she gets marked down for control and steering as she should have waited for a safer gap to move back in if it's too close to the gradient then you shouldn't overtake the cyclist traveling on a downhill gradient always cover the brake to control the speed of the vehicle eva does go slightly over the speed limit but she realizes quickly enough and steps off the accelerator,369.759,406.24,614,117,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=369,

as we're traveling down this narrow road with the railings close by either should have been braking going on the gradient as the car goes up to about 22 miles per hour as the road opens up either gets up to about 25 miles per hour she soon realizes and breaks straight away if she had not realized this would have gone up to a serious fault after 200 yards cross the roundabout and take the second exit v361 approaching the next roundabout to follow the road ahead either gets marked down for junction observation now there was a vehicle on her right but they were approaching a little bit slower but she should have given way to them,478.96,525.6,634,127,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=478,

as we're waiting at this round about to enter majority of the traffic ahead and traffic from the right were all turning left and going across our path so we needed to wait for a safe gap before we could enter as the traffic on the left-hand side had started to queue the van driver on the right hand side was waiting for us to enter and he was inviting eva into the road she realizes this but she doesn't move forward,637.04,658.24,417,86,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=637,
so so we're just going ahead for now okay,681.92,693.12,41,10,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=681,

after 100 yards turn left either continues at this junction without stopping now she could see the road and it was clear but if you're not sure it's better to stop look carefully and then emerge driving along this high street we should have been driving a little bit more carefully as there's a higher chance of a hazard developing down this road coming up to the traffic lights ahead there was a pedestrian waiting which means the traffic lights are more likely to change either should have stepped off the accelerator had the lights changed any earlier we would have had a very harsh stop at the point that they did change it was no longer safe for us to stop after 200 yards cross the roundabout and take the second exit,844.24,898.72,723,139,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=844,
cross the roundabout and take the second exit,926.0,928.399,45,9,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=926,
so [Music] so,949.68,961.36,13,5,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=949,

you can pull over and park on the right hand side of the road don't worry about the driveways on this occasion [Music] that's great though thank you all right so that's the end of your independent driving and we're now going to start the reversing exercise i'd like you to reverse back for about two car lengths keeping reasonably close to and parallel with the pavement as you carry out the exercise yeah okay and try not to touch the pavement [Music] before starting to reverse always make sure to check all around checking both left and right blind spot make sure that no one is passing your vehicle as you're reversing be sure to stop anytime anyone is passing your vehicle closely with the reversing exercise try and keep the wheel as straight as possible if you need to turn try and do small turns to the left or right eva starts to steer sharply towards the left which causes the back of her car to go towards the road she does realize that it's a little bit,1035.439,1122.64,965,193,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=1035,
too late as we're too far in the road by this point,1124.48,1126.4,51,13,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=1124,

at the roundabout and left please,1193.039,1193.039,33,7,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=1193,
coming up to this park car ahead eva stops behind as the road is not wide enough for two but as she moves forward she moves too close to the vehicle ahead before moving out she should have carried on waiting until there was a safer gap to a match you can pull over and park up on the left anywhere safe,1216.4,1241.2,302,63,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=1216,

leading up to the next roundabout eva gets a serious fault for awareness and planning there's a pedestrian approaching from the left-hand side who is not looking into the road and is walking right up towards the crossing now we didn't need to give way to her but because she was not looking it was not safe to continue the roundabout turned right it's the second exit eva was initially slowing down for the roundabout but she moved her foot over towards the accelerator well before knowing what the pedestrian was about to do approaching any junctions if you notice that there are pedestrians that are not looking into the road you need to be prepared to slow down and stop in case they don't see you and they walk straight out,1301.919,1348.08,727,143,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=1301,
so,1367.28,1367.28,2,1,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=1367,
and the roundabout and left is the first exit,1384.159,1386.24,45,10,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=1384,
and then just turn left in here please okay if you can pull it in park up on the left just behind that grey car just come in a little bit more just because we're parking here for a little while come in a little bit that's great thank you kill the car and just switch off the engine just give me a second again all right so that's the end of your driving test how was that drive for you that was awful really yeah this is that especially the start okay what happened on the start i don't know i feel like there were a million different things i did at like at the start rather than no there was any key points that stick out for you um i can't even remember all of them so there was one um do you want me to go over yeah okay all right okay um it was a good drive but there are two faults that kind of stuck out for me yeah um one of them okay so let's go through the faults okay so,1413.6,1495.44,881,193,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=1413,
it would be a fail on this occasion yeah but there's two main reasons but besides that there's a few others that kind of okay could have played out differently had the traffic been a little bit different so i feel like we need to be a little bit more cautious in places okay so the first one um sorry the first one of the major faults for me was actually your approach speed to one of the last roundabouts where that lady was on the left right we're approaching this roundabout we're turning right you're getting there a bit quick you're looking right and there's a pedestrian on the left-hand side and she's kind of walking while not even looking at you but walking kind of towards the crossing and as we've gone forward she stepped into the road just as you've gone past her i don't know yeah so it was just that was a bit dangerous because she could have just carried on walking without looking before you and i was about to hit the brakes there was,1497.2,1540.559,952,195,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=1497,
just a bit sudden so you've got to be a bit more careful with pedestrians there the other one was your reversing on the right now this one i feel like it was a bit it wasn't that bad yeah but it could have been yeah been good because what happened there is it wasn't that bad because you're reversing very nicely you're keeping it straight and then all of a sudden and i just i'm moving it's like steering and you started steering left and you're kind of looking and you're steering you kept going and i thought oh you did realize you did countersteer but we're already too far out now did you realize how much space you had so yeah you should just kept it straight what made you turn i thought i was going yeah i thought i was going too far we were actually okay the whole time you were you had a like a decent gap you probably had about a dream with don't you don't want to go any wider than yeah okay and then if you're,1541.76,1591.6,922,199,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=1541,
turning when you want to make it turn like this rather than turning like this because it went way too far out okay so that's your two major faults but besides that there's a few other things that are sticking out um use of speed yeah i went too far yeah how many times did you go over speed then yeah i noticed that yeah once it was up to 25 yeah and yeah every time you went over you did realize and you did slow it down but there are points where we probably don't want to go over speed like that like when we're approaching the junctions yeah especially on that high street as well let's talk about that high street um really nice there's no major issues along that high street but did you realize that traffic light that changed so quickly um oh when i i drove through it yeah so we're approaching this traffic light and you're accelerating there's a pedestrian that's just come come up and that traffic light he's gone and press the button and within seconds that light has changed,1593.2,1642.96,986,202,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=1593,
and as we're going through it's amber and we couldn't really stop yeah you didn't approach in a manner to be able to stop so that could have played out differently had we been a second later yeah and now you're forcing to a harsh stop right so yeah generally with like high streets like that the traffic lights do change very quickly because there's no other junctions close by and that pedestrian pedestrians tend to get impatient you have one of those puffing crossings on those high streets so the lights turn around time is seconds yeah yeah um we had a few faults with steering yeah i also went over the curb you went over the curb yeah that was the first steering fault the other one was sometimes when you're doing your left turns i'm going too far again you're going too far out yeah i was trying not to yeah you know then we had that clearance fault near the end as well you know when you got really close to that car on one of the roads where you were,1644.08,1694.64,961,196,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=1644,
giving away yeah when i went again yeah you saw that because and i thought oh am i being stupid is there enough space for two cars it was a bit of a it was a bit of a narrow gap you should have taken it slower it wasn't a major fault yeah but you did get close and we didn't need to so you needed to move over and then straighten up so you needed to move over earlier oh let's talk about that roundabout where you got hooted up yeah okay now there were no gaps were there no you're waiting you're waiting there's no gaps now the van driver on the right what did he do he told me to go he told you to go just checking yeah i wasn't sure yeah i wasn't sure if that's okay like if even if yeah yeah so that's when you got hooted and i did give you a bit of hesitation on that because he's clearly sitting there inviting you in,1695.679,1737.36,823,191,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=1695,
as long as nobody's trying to overtake him and ahead it's clear just look around and be on your way yeah you could see you couldn't go in at any point and honestly you didn't have any gaps you didn't actually miss any gaps there on that one but overall two majors but we've got a few minor especially that speeding thing we're gonna try and control that yeah but i think that one partly some of the issues are to do with the car because this car is a little bit quicker than what you're used to with the other one so i feel like some of these faults wouldn't have even happened yeah i noticed i went to like 25 i never tend to do that but yeah but no you were honestly driving as if you're just getting somewhere you're getting on with it which was great to see but there were points where i felt like we should have been a little bit slower here like the junctions but it's good that you're making progress you're just kind of going yeah,1739.2,1782.24,938,202,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=1739,
but just on the junctions being a bit slower and then yeah some of these speed ramps are like yeah okay all right that's the end of our mock test today hopefully that was useful can't speak so that's the end of our mock test today hopefully that video has been useful don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe to the channel if you have not already and there'll be more videos to come bye [Music],1784.72,1811.55,418,88,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=1784,

[Music] muhammad did check all around before moving but by the time he moved there was a long delay from the initial check so he should have checked over towards the right checking his right blind spot again [Music] at the end of the road turn right please [Music],108.67,138.7,264,56,f52g6LkQzN4,1840,https://youtu.be/f52g6LkQzN4?t=108,
as we turned into the new road mohammed notices an oncoming vehicle in advance and stops in good time but when waiting in this position you should always check your mirrors towards the right as they could very easily be a motorbike or an overtaken vehicle [Music],171.519,192.04,263,54,f52g6LkQzN4,1840,https://youtu.be/f52g6LkQzN4?t=171,
if you can pull over and park up on the left piece somewhere safe when parking up somewhere safe always make sure to park next to a raised curb muhammad initially stops a bit too early but carries on rolling until he gets to the high curb and this would be a safe place to park okay drive in front of you already [Music] and then just turn the left in here please [Music] at the end of the road turn right please [Music],207.36,275.21,420,91,f52g6LkQzN4,1840,https://youtu.be/f52g6LkQzN4?t=207,
mohammed deals with this new junction really well as the new road is really busy he waits for the right hand side of the road to clear before moving half out once he's half out somebody from the left is giving way [Music],303.039,324.07,221,48,f52g6LkQzN4,1840,https://youtu.be/f52g6LkQzN4?t=303,

muhammad should have waited for the black car he chose to move a bit too late so it wasn't necessarily safe for us to enter at this point [Music],433.599,441.78,145,33,f52g6LkQzN4,1840,https://youtu.be/f52g6LkQzN4?t=433,
okay so we're just going to turn right into the car park coming up as we're going forward mohammad should have positioned in the middle of the road before making the turn but he ends up getting a serious fault for awareness and planning with the pedestrian on the right he starts turning into the road with the bus oncoming and he ends up stalling as he's in second gear,460.08,476.16,370,77,f52g6LkQzN4,1840,https://youtu.be/f52g6LkQzN4?t=460,

muhammad did park well but the front of his car had gone over into the space ahead he simply needed to reverse back about a meter or so and we would have been parked fully in the space,528.959,536.959,184,39,f52g6LkQzN4,1840,https://youtu.be/f52g6LkQzN4?t=528,
once out of the space mohammed just needs to steer a little bit towards the left to park fully in the center of the space as he goes forward he starts steering towards the right are you happy to leave it there yeah just secure the car and just switch off the engine okay all right just give me a few minutes once you finish parking if you're not sure how you've parked make sure you secure the car and then open your door to check to see where the line is if you're not happy with how you've parked you can readjust the examiner may sometimes get out of the car to go out and check to make sure that you're not over the line okay whenever you're ready we'll start the engine and we'll reverse that up here,569.04,618.48,705,151,f52g6LkQzN4,1840,https://youtu.be/f52g6LkQzN4?t=569,

traveling along on a dual carriageway like this you should aim to move over to the right when you can see the roundabout sign starting to approach or if the traffic's building up you can move over earlier muhammad moves into the right hand lane too late and by this point the traffic on the right is starting to slow down which he doesn't realize,811.44,827.279,346,73,f52g6LkQzN4,1840,https://youtu.be/f52g6LkQzN4?t=811,

okay if you could just pull over and park on the right hand side of the road don't worry about the drives on this one okay i'll be great there thank you secure the car switch off the engine brilliant at the end of your driving test give me a second please all right so how was the test for you today mohammed it feels great made quite a few mistakes quite a few mistakes okay now unfortunately it would be a fail okay and there's a few things um i was quite concerned about that one time that i had to use the break yeah yeah so what happened there why did i need to intervene at that point i was supposed to turn right i'm not running about i didn't get into the right name early enough yeah so instead of i should have just gone in the middle lane yeah i'm taking a different route but yeah last minute i just yeah you left it very late to try and move over didn't you,1469.039,1543.2,870,186,f52g6LkQzN4,1840,https://youtu.be/f52g6LkQzN4?t=1469,
yeah by the time you did try and move over it was getting too close to the roundabout at that point honestly you would have been better off like you said going ahead when you switched over behind that car my heart was pounding when i had to press the brake there were you scared of how close we were getting yeah yeah did you realize how close we got before i had to break yeah yeah that was that was dangerously close don't ever put yourself in that sort of position but you knew quite early on that you were turning right yeah you were looking you had your finger on the indicator you're looking you're checking the roundabout's coming and you just didn't put your indicator on okay a few other things i want to talk about um there was that round about the very beginning where you lady margaret road we were turning left that black car turned up now you moved in front of him did you realize how frustrated he was behind us okay now he was a bit of an aggressive driver anyways he wasn't the nicest sort,1545.44,1596.72,1006,204,f52g6LkQzN4,1840,https://youtu.be/f52g6LkQzN4?t=1545,
of person but you took the wrong gap you did slow him down and then he was a bit frustrated behind us oh when i went into it oh okay yeah yeah so that was your first serious fault there then came the bit where we were going into the golf center yep golf starring my mom said golf center the um when we were turning into the football bit that right turn with that pedestrian that was serious wasn't it because he was halfway crossing we decided to turn and then you couldn't turn and now there's a bus approaching so there's a few things of awareness and planning on that one um then there was um there's a lot of left mirror checks not missing so you generally don't check this mirror when you're turning okay do you feel that that's the case yeah i don't check it yeah i can't fault you on roundabouts honestly roundabouts were fine all of them very nicely done it was just that observation on the first one lady margaret but all the,1598.72,1654.08,934,195,f52g6LkQzN4,1840,https://youtu.be/f52g6LkQzN4?t=1598,
other roundabouts she did them really well but i just feel like you could check your mirrors a little bit more just kind of be more aware of your surroundings on the roundabouts yeah um a few times when you're moving off you're forgetting your right blind spot okay well you kind of check it and then you're waiting for two or three cars and then you don't check it again yeah do you feel like that's the case yeah um [Music] that parking how was your parking i have no idea i had to get out and check um the reason i had to get out is because i was suspicious that that front right tire was over the line and we were actually nearly in the bay in front as well weren't we now even when you park the first time you went over the line then you reversed you're looking around you kind of backed it up and you went forward by the end of it your tyre was still over kind of just half on in half in the,1656.32,1711.12,897,194,f52g6LkQzN4,1840,https://youtu.be/f52g6LkQzN4?t=1656,
other space okay so it wasn't great yeah now you did back it up but back it up by the length of your car and then kind of really just sit tall and see how you've parked and kind of just adjust it you kind of just went forward again yeah it was a good attempt but it's just yeah we needed to make sure we're not on that line there okay there's a few things you could tidy up but i think definitely um you'll get there you just need to keep practicing now the roundabouts were fine i think you were probably more scared about the roundabouts and those you did fine so how was this mock test experience for you i think it was good clean up on my mistakes all right and the last thing was that emergency stop so i got you to do the emergency stop twice but the first time was very much unsatisfactory yeah with your break how was it yeah it's just i didn't impress the pedophile yeah you know it's an emergency stop,1713.6,1767.279,911,197,f52g6LkQzN4,1840,https://youtu.be/f52g6LkQzN4?t=1713,
you've got to be firm on that break okay you came into the break too lightly i did get you to do it again but not every examiner is going to give you that chance they'll they'll take you for the first one okay so overall you know what you're doing you just need to keep practicing okay and you've got a month from your test so i think that's plenty of time for you to clear up some of these things but um yeah that's the end of your mock test today summarize it up for me how was it for you could be better but you get an idea of what's required from you yeah yeah coming up to some of these faults did you realize you were making those faults yeah i knew straight away that's good it's good it shows good awareness that you knew that was happening but it's just now we need to cover it before it even happens stop that mistake from happening okay all right so that's the end of our mock,1768.799,1814.399,887,192,f52g6LkQzN4,1840,https://youtu.be/f52g6LkQzN4?t=1768,

and i'll give you directions throughout [Music] you have to have the break and clutch on and then start it won't start otherwise no car's not on,126.799,144.0,144,32,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=126,

if you could pull over and park up on the left anywhere safe [Music] thank you travis you're ready when moving off from this park position hannah gets another minor fault for moving off safety she does initially look all around from the point she looked around actually moving off there was a long delay so she needs to check towards the road and over her shoulder again [Music],204.4,242.07,378,76,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=204,
hannah stalls the engine due to changing gears a bit too early as we're going uphill she should have waited until the car was a little bit faster before changing into second gear [Music] all right at the end of the roads and left keys [Music],258.479,286.53,242,52,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=258,

coming up to the road works ahead hannah gets a serious fault for awareness and planning she positions right next to the center line but there's not enough space for any oncoming traffic to pass she should have positioned more towards the left at this point and it does quickly readjust but the van had already stopped by this point she should have started moving as soon as she saw the van approaching and this would have gone down as a minor fault take the next road on your right case after the road works hannah should have moved back towards the left hand side of the road before turning right she continues to turn from the wrong side getting a serious fault for position turning right [Music],368.16,429.36,699,135,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=368,
as we get to the end of this road hannah continues without stopping but she does look both ways but if you're not sure if the road is clear it's better to stop have a good look and then continue [Music],447.759,464.17,202,46,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=447,
if you can pull over and park up on the left somewhere safe [Music] sorry it's okay you secure the car for a second okay all right when you're ready drive off when moving off from a park position always remember to do a final check towards the right if you're waiting for a few cars to pass remember to look over your shoulder towards the road again as this could be an issue if there was a junction on the right or if there was someone in your blind spot about to move off at the same time as you [Music] and then take the next road on your right please [Music],495.039,568.2,562,122,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=495,
if you can pull over and park on the right hand side of the road don't worry about the driveways on this occasion just anywhere on the right is fine [Music] that's great thank you all right hannah what i'd like you to do now is to reverse back for about two car lengths keeping a reasonable distance from the pavement and try not to touch the curb so reverse back the two car lens piece,595.519,622.88,386,83,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=595,
continue reversing for another college that'd be great though thank you and drive often if you're ready,662.079,674.8,103,19,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=662,

at the end of this road turn right [Music],752.399,755.69,42,11,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=752,
after stalling the engine at this point hannah gets a serious fault for move-off control and observation vehicles are starting to pass on the right and she should have looked around i also had to talk her through how to move off as she kept rolling back don't worry about the handbrake just prepare your feet and you'll be fine [Music] you're changing into second gear too early on an uphill gradient that's why the car keeps switching off okay it's off now no no it's on now just when you're ready slowly move off again okay just wait for the van just wait for the fan and then move off just press the accelerator and there it is just lift that clutch a little bit just a tiny little lift and hold and then we're moving you have to wait a little bit when changing into second on a gradient [Music] so we're turning left here the road that we're moving on to is fairly busy so you need to make sure the,788.079,871.839,902,193,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=788,
traffic on the left-hand side has started to pile up and the key clear box ahead you can move on to when the traffic on the right is waiting behind as we go left at this t-junction hannah gets a dangerous fault for control and steering she ends up going over the pavement on the left-hand side with her front and back left tires the lorry on the right-hand side was giving her way but she needed to move forward out of the junction and then slowly start to steer left so when we go up there we're just going to turn left okay,873.92,902.079,525,112,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=873,
we're going to crash into that car but you went fully on the paper in there okay just just wait just continue now slowly just turn left at the traffic lights there okay [Music],920.399,936.25,176,37,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=920,
as we're going forward the two lanes start to match it's a good idea to use your mirrors towards the right in case of overtaking vehicles as the right-hand lane merges inwards,972.56,980.079,175,37,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=972,
while driving along on the stool carriageway hannah gets a serious fault for position normal driving she's driving over the center line and nearly into the middle lane somebody that was driving in the middle lane was forced to move into the third lane to avoid us,999.12,1010.56,263,52,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=999,
hannah tends to keep her hands quite low when holding the steering wheel now this isn't a serious fault holding your hands like this but as long as you can control the steering driving at higher speeds the steering wheel is more sensitive the best position to hold your hands on the steering is at a quarter to three position hannah gets the control steering fault as we're going forward she starts driving over the white line on the right while the red fan is passing she has to suddenly steer left to avoid the van i'm going to take the exit just coming off coming up to take the exit from this carriageway hannah doesn't check her mirrors or indicate she's about to miss the exit so i had to remind her that we're turning off she starts moving left without checking or indicating it's all coming off coming off here,1029.439,1093.039,818,165,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=1029,
[Music] and traffic lights turn left okay,1129.75,1135.2,41,9,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=1129,
as we turn left at these traffic lights the new road has two lanes hannah moves into the overtaking lane in the new road which gives her a minor fault [Music] as we go forward down this road hannah starts moving towards the left without checking her mirrors or indicating with two vehicles present on her left giving her a serious fault for use of mirrors changing direction again [Music] at the roundabout we're gonna go straight on it's the first exit [Music],1157.28,1203.55,461,95,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=1157,
okay at the roundabout we're gonna follow the road ahead towards west elite [Music],1230.88,1239.63,83,18,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=1230,
and then turn left at this round about first exit please [Music] if you can pull over and park on the left just after this bus stop it's kind of in the shade of that tree just gonna move into that space there just slow it right down we're gonna be stopping here for a little while just break just right down stop there i'll be fine that'll be fine just before that it's overgrown all right secure the car and just switch off the engine all right just give me a few minutes okay [Music] so we're gonna go through that now all right so that's the end of your test how was that for you there's quite a lot of things happening there wasn't there [Music] and i don't feel like it's all to do with the car and i know the gears you struggled a little bit with you change between cars and stuff but most of the other stuff it's kind of your awareness of what's,1254.799,1323.84,852,190,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=1254,
going on around you so i'm just going to go over the main point so firstly um you had a little bit of trouble with the gears the car switched off on that gradient didn't it yeah did you realize why it switched off because it kind of struggled to get going yeah did you realize it's because you were changing too early i wasn't adding enough gas yeah and plus with the gear change because you take a little bit too long actually clutching changing bringing it up that's what's causing the car to slow down so much so the car slows down quite quickly going uphill as soon as you step off the accelerator and then on top of that we're trying to go into a higher gear which doesn't have the same power as gear 1 did so that's why the car was really struggling and it turned off and we just stood there for a little while steering you know with that junction with that lorry was on the right of you he was giving you way yeah he's looking,1325.44,1372.0,933,197,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=1325,
at you isn't he so you know he's giving you way but you should have thought about the way we're coming out you just did the whole thing even the front tire hit the pavement not even the back so we needed to come out the junction didn't we you kind of just turned on the spot so that was a big issue there um moving off safety now this is something you are checking you're looking all around but then let's say there's two or three cars and you're waiting for that car and you know okay i can go after that one or you know you check both these two mirrors but you don't check your blind spot again and that happened a few times and the points that was happening it was quite main so you need to recheck that blind spot over your shoulder is that something that's been brought to your attention before yeah yeah then we had use of mirrors change direction which was just over here so when we turned off of that dual,1374.08,1420.799,913,192,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=1374,
carriageway and we turned left the road was really wide you went into the overtaking lane which is fine we should have stayed in the left lane anyways but once you were in the overtaking lane you decided to move left with no mirrors no signal there was a car behind but they weren't very close i didn't have to take control but you just you're not letting anybody know what you're about to do and you're not really checking okay and then lastly lane discipline you know when we were driving on that forty road yeah you realize you got hooted right why was that because i was hogging the lane i was like yeah you were kind of over that white line and even later after that we had a bit of a jolt even later you kept looking down that's the issue like i kept thinking like am i in the right gear like should i move up so you so you were never in the wrong gear like you were just changing gears a bit too early but you were never in the wrong gear,1422.24,1472.08,945,205,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=1422,
yeah so i feel like sometimes the gear lever was just distracting you kept looking down and then that was kind of affecting the drive as well yeah okay i want to just talk about that bit with the traffic light oh okay so as we went forward we got some road works in front yeah now you've kind of positioned yourself in the middle yeah and then what happened the guy beeps because i was in his way yeah so the guy turned up you did realize straight away so you move you should really be thinking about well if this road works there's going to be traffic where are they going to get through yeah so a bit more planning on what the other cars in front will be doing where they're going to position how are you feeling ah a bit stressed maybe i told you to take your jacket off i told you you're gonna get hot it's the weather it's not helping um there were lots of steering concerns the major one you know which was the bit,1472.96,1523.919,920,190,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=1472,
where you ended up on the pavement but besides that um we think where it was most of the on the carriage where when you you you know your hands on the steering you keep them quite low you're allowed to hold it like that but i felt like that was partly to blame for how you're steering on that carriageway so try and keep your hands kind of just above that three o'clock position so either 10 to two or quarter to three because your hand was down here and i felt like that was kind of the reason why you kept leaning right the maneuver was really good though yeah so pull up on the right and reversing two car lengths that was really good um just you did look right blind spot very late though because you kind of thoroughly checked here and you went all the way to that mirror and then you didn't check you started reversing and then you remembered so that was good but you've got to have a good look because there was there's like,1525.36,1579.84,931,193,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=1525,
i think there might have been an entrance on the right soon but no nobody was there nobody was around the whole time and even with reversing you could see it was a little out so you even managed to kind of wiggle your way in towards the pavements that was great okay so there are good parts to your drive as well but the bits that we need to go work on we're gonna go work on some of these things now and then that will hopefully help you for your future lessons okay i'm gonna go through the rest of this with you now okay all right so that's the end of our mock test video today hopefully that will be useful for you hannah going forward now we're going to go work on some of these things as well so don't worry but um hopefully you can now learn from this because you have got plenty of time before your test so don't worry okay all right so that's the end of the test hopefully it's been useful don't forget to like the video comment down below and,1580.64,1626.24,952,203,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=1580,

ask a quick question could you tell me how would you check that your headrest is correctly adjusted um the middle of the headdress should be in line with your ears and your eyes as well okay in the middle that's fine all right brilliant so yeah we're gonna get started so whenever you're ready you can start the engine all right thank you for everyone that's been watching hopefully you like watching these videos and actually learn something as well so don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe to the channel all right good luck whenever you're ready let's drive off [Music],76.4,127.67,598,118,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=76,

we're going to follow the road ahead from here coming up to this roundabout jamil nearly gets a serious fault because he starts signaling left as he enters the roundabout had there been other vehicles around us this would have gone down as a serious fault as they'll think that he's taking the first exit but in fact he was going ahead [Music] at the roundabout turn right it's the third exit [Music] leading up to the roundabout jamil should have been breaking as we couldn't see on the right hand side as he stops the back of the car is partially on the crossing aim to try and stop before the zebra crossing he does wait for a safe gap before entering [Music],188.319,251.41,662,142,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=188,
we're going to follow the road ahead from here it's the second exit [Music] second exit is sign posted just after 12 so jamil starts in the right hand lane with the right signal the roundabout has a very open view and we can see that the vehicles on the right are in fact going ahead so we didn't need to stop jamil gets a minor fault for response to road marking as he goes over the giveaway line to stop [Music] driving down this road jameel's driving nicely up to the speed of the road but the vehicle behind still decides to overtake at this point it's not an issue if they're overtaking just be aware that they are but as we're going forward the road opens up into two lanes and both of them are going ahead always keep to the left lane if both lanes are going ahead as that's the position for normal driving unless you know you are making a right turn soon,269.12,335.6,862,188,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=269,

jameel's progress on this slip road is a little bit slow as it's a 40 slip road and he's only really getting up to about 26 miles per hour but this wasn't an issue as the main road wasn't exactly at 40 at this point once in the new road jamil should have sped up as the road was starting to get up to about 40 miles per hour but he continued driving around 26 miles per hour getting a minor fault for progress now nobody was majorly affected so it's not a serious fault so we're going to take the exit coming off this next slip row,394.479,445.84,531,124,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=394,
we're gonna go ahead at the roundabout it's the second exit leading up to a roundabout from a slip road keep to the left lane when going ahead the only time you would use the right hand lane is if you can see clear left only arrow in the left hand lane now jamil goes into the overtaking position to go ahead this was okay but it just makes it harder to exit the roundabout,472.24,492.4,373,82,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=472,
as you can see here we're now having to switch back into the left hand lane in order to take the exit this would have been very difficult had there been a vehicle on our left [Music],515.919,529.16,182,40,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=515,
ahead of us there's an obstruction on the left which is partially blocking the left-hand lane jamil notices the hazard in really good time and starts using his mirrors to switch lanes because of the speed of the road you want to deal with this hazard as early as possible so it's not dangerous for others around you [Music] once back in the left lane jamil is making progress but very slowly he's up to about 30 miles per hour at this point and he's slowly making progress so he gets another minor fault for progress appropriate speed when we get to the round thumb take the first stakes of lift driving along in this dual carriageway you can see the road marking now differs the white line to the right of us indicates that this lane is now coming off the deal carriageway so now the middle lane would be the normal driving position for following the road jamil ahead starts to slow down in good time but he doesn't put the clutch down,565.12,647.12,936,193,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=565,
when he's slow so he nearly switches off the engine in fourth gear as we're going uphill you need to switch down to a lower gear so that you have more power to get up the gradient [Music],648.88,671.58,187,42,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=648,
there's a bus lane starting ahead as soon as jamil realizes he starts using his mirrors and moves into the overtaking lane on this occasion he doesn't get a serious fault as he is keeping up with the flow of the traffic and this road's not too long until we reach the next roundabout always read the blue signs on approach to a bus lane to make sure that you're outside the hours of operation and then you can use the bus lane the times here are monday to friday 7 to 10 a.m and 4 to 7 pm so we are allowed to use the bus lane outside of those hours right now when we get to the next roundabout i'd like you to take the second exit towards heathrow coming up to the next roundabout heathrow is signposted about 10 o'clock and it's the second exit so jamil should move into the left-hand lane once the bus lane finishes he continues driving in the right-hand lane which is only for,697.76,752.32,880,198,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=697,

[Music] going into the roundabout from this lane you're restricted to taking the exits just towards the right jamil does check his mirrors and starts moving over lanes but he does disrupt the flow of the traffic in that lane so it gets a serious fault for this it would have been better to just go around the roundabout or take a different exit at this point [Music] the lane we're in naturally puts us into the overtaking position on the exit once on the dual carriageway jamil should have moved back into the left-hand lane to get back into the position for normal driving he continues driving in the overtaking lane for the length of the road,779.86,841.6,645,134,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=779,

all right so on this next roundabout we're going to take the second exit towards green fed it's b455 sorry the third exit so it's a third exit sorry approaching this roundabout greenfield is the third exit which is past 12 o'clock so we need to start in the right hand lane as we go into the roundabout we don't want to go into the lane closest to the roundabout as that will take us to the fourth exit or to make a u-turn and that's where jamil ends up,1171.44,1196.32,453,105,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=1171,
as we enter the roundabout jamil realizes he's gotten into the wrong lane and he starts using his mirrors and signaling in order to change lanes but there was a vehicle right next to us and he causes them to slow down getting a serious fault for use of mirrors to change direction [Music],1213.919,1241.3,288,59,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=1213,

if you can pull it and park up on the left-hand side just before the speed ramp just over there that's great thank you secure the car is it locked push and switch off the engine okay so that's the end of your driving test just give me a few minutes okay jamil that's the end of your driving test now unfortunately it wouldn't be a pass on this occasion there's a few reasons why but um how was the drive for you overall i'm not the best not the best what bit did you not like the most um i think i stole the car a couple of times maybe yeah back here yeah um and my indication wasn't always right especially during roundabouts i realized too late because there's a few things yeah so i'm gonna go over the main points with you okay and then we'll go over all the rest of them later so the first main one for me was you know when we were driving towards heathrow yeah yeah we're driving in the,1645.039,1711.36,892,195,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=1645,
overtaking lane the bus lane you weren't using it as we went forward to the roundabout heathrow was the second exit which was kind of before 12 o'clock but you've started in the lane on the right so as you've gone forward into the roundabout you're now in the lane that's near enough closest to the roundabout and you've checked you've signaled you've had to move over there was a van behind so you've kind of moved into that lane yeah we should have been planning that if i'm taking the exit before 12 start on the left lane yeah so the bustling did come to an end and then you've got two lanes on the left now and then you're in the third one so that's why that lane's not going to take you to his room okay so that was the first one then as we're going forward because you've come off that roundabout in the overtaking lane you've just carried on in the overtaking lane,1714.08,1757.76,872,198,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=1714,
are you not supposed to move back into the left one yeah yeah you did check your mirrors at one point but you didn't signal you just carried on straight in that road for quite a while and then now the next round about was coming up and i thought okay we're going to turn right anyway so that's fine but you didn't know you were going to be turning right so we're again in the overtaking lane when we don't need to be so that give you a serious fault for position normal driving because you keep going into the overtaking lane when you don't need to be there okay um then we came up to white hart roundabout again the second time and we were taking the exit towards greenford which was kind of after 12 o'clock yeah you've gone into the roundabout again you've gone to the lane closest to the roundabout and then you're trying to change and there was that bmw grayish kind of lady she was right in that blind spot now she,1758.88,1801.679,920,199,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=1758,
happened to slow down for you but you're literally right there and moving in front of her if you know you're going the wrong way what do you do keep on going ahead keep going the wrong way you should have just gone round or made sure that you given her a bit more time to kind of let you let her know that you're coming in so that gave you a use of mirrors change direction again on that same roundabout and the 20 zone how many times did we go over that 20 zone yeah so i had to tell you twice because at one point you were 24 the next time you're 25 and it was just going higher so i had to keep reminding you it is 20. even once going over that speed and keeping it at that speed for a while like if you were just briefly up to 20 over 20 and you'd slowed down that would have been okay but you were just going for it there were loads of signs you have to,1803.76,1847.52,858,198,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=1803,
keep looking okay and i know we spoke about this earlier you said you're familiar with those 20 zones yeah in london yeah so you've got to make sure you watch those speeds so with the bay parking it was good but you did get a minor fault on that with your control because you had to adjust didn't you yeah so you decided you wanted to park on the right the car park's pretty empty just come over all the way left and then just drive into it that way you won't have to reverse would you yeah because you started right it was really tricky to get that straight angle parking okay so i've given you a steering and serious as you were driving along on yeting lane i asked you to park up on the left got so much space to park up it was like this actually it was nice and straight so as you're driving i said okay park up on the left someone say if you've slowed down your mirror signal everything's in as you're moving towards the pavement,1849.039,1893.84,934,197,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=1849,
you're kind of carrying most of your speed i looked at the speed it was still 21 when you were right next to the pavement and you were trying to get it even closer and you you've not got your clutch down and you're not actually slow so as soon as you know you're parking mirror signal start slowing down brake clutch and keep rolling but at a much slower speed i only reached the wheel because it was getting too close for the speed that you're traveling okay and i don't want to take the risk of cutting the tire like that because if you touch the pavement at low speeds you're not going to do much damage but at high speeds yeah what's going to happen yeah you're going to cut your tire there was one you know what there was one right near the beginning which nearly gave you a serious fault so we came up to the first roundabout it was quite a small roundabout and i said go ahead the roundabout has that blue arrow,1896.08,1941.039,918,193,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=1896,
and as you've gone forward you've indicated left you've gone past the first exit and then indicated left again had somebody been on that first round about that would have given you a serious fault straight away do you know which one i mean yeah i think so yeah um then you know when we were driving on the a40 it was 40 miles per hour you joined the slippers really nicely but then you were driving quite slow you were driving 25 when it's 40 and i know the traffic wasn't at 40 which is what saved you a little bit but there's still points where we could have sped up a little bit more yeah did you realize you were slow on that road yeah you did speed up a little bit more later but it just just took a bit too long and now i know you mentioned the gears but let's talk about when you're gearing down because when we were in fourth gear approaching that roundabout the car nearly cut off didn't it on that,1943.44,1990.399,907,196,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=1943,
gradient yeah it did yeah that's what you want about the the gear thing right yeah yeah make sure when you're slowing down that you're knocking the gears down as well it'll put the clutch in a bit early because you're too slow for the gear that you're in okay and even here we turned off the engine before coming in yeah you're traveling in third gear what's the minimum that third gear will do um 30 minimum 25 minutes third okay 15 15. yeah okay so if you're driving because the thing is when you but that's not the speed that you change into third so when you're driving in second you speed up to above 20 and you go third right so driving in third 20 plus if you're slowing down from 30 let's say you can slow down as far as 15 and then put the clutch down if you wanted to we don't always get it to that number but you can what you're doing is you're bringing it,1992.0,2044.96,867,198,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=1992,
well below that number that's when the car is struggling so when you were in fourth gear your speed was coming down below 20 miles per hour that the car was about to switch off it was actually at 16. so i looked at the speed at the time and same here we were down to about 12 10. that's why the car turned off afterwards because the the gear just can't cope with that speed and that's the same thing that happened when we got into that car park do you remember when you when you turned into the car park and then you said oh what am i what am i doing i was concerned about the gear because you were in second and the car was nearly cutting off stop stopping yeah so you've got to realize when you're traveling too slow for the gear what sort of warning does the car give you vibrate okay yeah john is a little bit but that's quite late that warning okay so as soon as your speed is coming down you should be thinking wait should i,2046.48,2091.599,930,202,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=2046,
change gear yeah you'll feel it um there is a lot of good things about your drive like you on those roundabouts you were checking your mirrors even when you knew you were in the wrong lane you're checking you're not just kind of moving over which is great but now you need to make sure when you're checking that you're not just cutting people off because you're looking at that lady you know she's right there but you've still moved in front of her she happened to adjust for us but not everyone will know that you're trying to move over okay so it's more of a safety thing on that one yeah generally you know whenever the road went into two lanes and two lanes and both of those lanes were going straight you you happen to kind of keep getting into the right one and then people around us who now want to overtake are going on the left overtake which then puts you in danger so you should make sure if the road opens into two and they're both going,2093.44,2141.52,949,198,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=2093,
straight can you see left and keep left yeah unless you know you're gonna be turning right then fine stick to the right okay but we'll go over all of these little things now okay so how are you feeling about your mock test today is this what you kind of expected yeah i was expecting this yeah i was um didn't go too well for me yeah i was okay with it yeah that's right as long as you know what you need to do going forward from here yeah that's what you don't want to go because at the end of the day if i give you a really easy route and you're like yeah i passed it's great but then i it's just because of the roads we're using if you get a challenging route you know exactly what areas you need to address now going forward because then you've got plenty of time before your test actually tidy some of this up okay let you know what you're doing you're confident which is good but you just need to,2143.119,2191.839,902,196,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=2143,

i'm planning well ahead i can see that there's a width restrictor and i'm going to start thinking about how to deal with that it's not my car either so i'm going to take it super seriously super serious yeah okay cool so i'm going to drop it into one i'll probably go through this in a second and not slow down at all but because i'm on video and i'm respecting the hazard let's take it really slowly it's all right yeah good cool um what are they saying oh yeah i'm taking the road slowly i'm not going too fast because it's a really narrow residential road and if you look behind the parked cars you can't see them right at the end okay can't see the pavement so anything could be behind there anything could jump out at you mirror signal routine every single time position speed dropping into first gear i'm not taking it seriously enough no you are now okay uh what's the title of this video gonna be i have no idea driving strikes is not,442.16,503.919,942,201,SsPcN6Ho-ZE,1550,https://youtu.be/SsPcN6Ho-ZE?t=442,
taking it seriously 17 18 this road's a little bit wider so i'm going at 20 miles an hour because i've got lots more room around me i'm not close to the parked cars at all let's check the mirror before we move into the left and i'm planning ahead so i can see i'm going to crash into this grey car if i don't move so mirror check first before that should get nervous then nope i'm going to crash into the all good you trust me with your car with your shiny mercedes how nice is this car to drive though so good crime scene crime scene investigation csi in the house interesting at the end of the road let's turn left please oh towards leadership yes let's do it mirror [Music] signal position and speed i'm gonna drop it into one before i get to the end so i can look right and if i can go without stopping i will 100 do that when moving out at this junction you want to be mindful of,505.759,570.32,884,200,SsPcN6Ho-ZE,1550,https://youtu.be/SsPcN6Ho-ZE?t=505,
the traffic from the left as they will be moving into the central reservation to make a right turn and also to go around the bus that's on the bus stop opposite because it's a giveaway it's not a stoplight would you expect your learners to do that definitely yeah like that yeah definitely especially because cars behind you can see exactly what you can see so if they can see it's clear they wouldn't expect you to stop and accidents happen because of that and we definitely don't want to cause accidents on camera true but we couldn't exactly see until quite late so you don't want to make a rash decision yeah that's why i approached it really slowly were you happy with that would you normally say stop acting right i'd say take it a bit slower than the way you did still still move out story if need be but just take it a bit slower yeah okay because it felt a bit hasty coming out to the left like that i know you'd looked initially,571.839,623.36,938,193,SsPcN6Ho-ZE,1550,https://youtu.be/SsPcN6Ho-ZE?t=571,
but it's just someone from the opposite side could have been coming across into the middle like because there was that bus opposite us so we have to be considerate of the houses on the opposite side as well so wise have we got stuck in traffic now yeah a little bit i'm allowed to take my hands off the wheel when i'm stationary um i'd always say keep one hand on the steering but you're gonna stay when you're completely stationary you'll be fine like this personally completely stationary like this with the handbrake on yeah without the hammer with the hamburgers keep do you say to people to go neutral handbrake when you're stopped for more than five seconds because i know that a lot of old school instructors do you say that um when they get a little bit more comfortable driving then yeah so chill out handbrake neutral what about traffic lights handbrake or footbrake um hambrick if they're comfortable with it but my car has a hold assist you can,624.8,679.6,956,197,SsPcN6Ho-ZE,1550,https://youtu.be/SsPcN6Ho-ZE?t=624,
put it on hold oh yeah that's another feature that you can teach people that my car does that too but i don't usually teach people that because they're not going to get a mercedes-a-class when they first go through the new features like this you can try this out but see your own car whenever you get it yeah hold there yeah it's as good as having a hamburger can you see that on that one maybe yeah not sure zoom in on the hold i can see the bustline's ending so what i'm going to do now move our signal move across i'm going to cancel that signal nice and early though so that doesn't look like i'm turning left because i'm not telling you with most new cards you can indicate briefly kind of lightly uh triple ten yeah so people hit that by accident they get really confused yeah they're like oh when you know you want to do a lane change like you just did there they can you can just briefly put it on,681.44,724.8,905,195,SsPcN6Ho-ZE,1550,https://youtu.be/SsPcN6Ho-ZE?t=681,
tap it three times well just tapping it once and then it kind of comes goes on and it indicates yeah that's really useful especially changing lanes on a motorway just boom move across and then forget about it not like that one right away no no no no unless you're me i'm not taking it seriously then you might be doing that on the motorway here around the back of the shopping center we're having a right little uh exploration of lewisham this is great this is fun having fun yeah bloody love driving so good so good driving is so much fun honestly if you don't have a license you're missing out if you're not learning to drive well probably while you're watching this but if you don't have a driving license get one driving is the best driving yeah it's kind of convenient that you're driving straight from um nice little high street fan of lotion it's okay it's really busy would you come back and make a left at those traffic lights,725.839,786.24,935,193,SsPcN6Ho-ZE,1550,https://youtu.be/SsPcN6Ho-ZE?t=725,
um yeah i don't mind it's quite nice is this the uh biggest police station you were talking about this is it yes biggest police station goes all the way back and they have horses in there they have the police horses live in that police station so yeah never been inside there not that kind of person take something seriously just maybe not driving videos it auto revs a little bit every time the clutch is lifted okay so let's go into neutral so that you can save petrol because petrol is really expensive oh what's this idiot doing can i heat him no no check the left side if you're gonna move over this way sorry it's all right just because i started going back into driving lesson mode there clearly i need it uh so we're going to turn left again from here when approaching traffic lights that have been green for a while you should always step off the accelerator in case they were to change there's a point where you can stop and when you're too,787.76,850.24,950,191,SsPcN6Ho-ZE,1550,https://youtu.be/SsPcN6Ho-ZE?t=787,
close you would continue the point that the light started changing francis started to accelerate to make the traffic light giving him a serious fault for response to traffic lights the left and middle lane oh you're gonna skip that light this slow yep okay because i know always there's traffic on the parked cars on the left so if you start on the right you'll end up on the right and you can avoid those uh park cars top tip from someone who's done less drive testing amber light yeah what does that mean speed up i'm so annoyed right now francis don't drive on my channel can you smell your child no don't swear you're gonna beep out i don't know maybe maybe listen i don't know how to but maybe uh okay so we need to move back into the left because if we stay here yeah we need to go towards the other we are going to end up going all the way around the roundabout stevenage that's what it said that was signposted,851.92,908.56,918,196,SsPcN6Ho-ZE,1550,https://youtu.be/SsPcN6Ho-ZE?t=851,
this bus this bus driver mugged me right off he moved forward and i thought he was setting off but he wasn't you're just moving to the end of the bus stand oh that's a mess about cheers mate oh seven oaks not stevenage sorry steven she's really far away did you like however did that reverse in there i took it seriously and did all my checks you're happy with that yeah great okay awesome doing so well here my examiner is so impressed it is good to impress your examiner it's really good to impress your examiner just be nice be friendly um and give them a nice rock drive give them a nice smooth drive like i'm giving you i'll give you a little tip as well on your driving test the examiners have icebreaker questions so they will ask you stuff like what would you be doing if you weren't here right now or have you come far for your driving test just to break the ice and make you feel a little bit more relaxed if you have an icebreaker,911.36,968.32,941,202,SsPcN6Ho-ZE,1550,https://youtu.be/SsPcN6Ho-ZE?t=911,
question for the examiner just get it out straight away you'll feel so much more relaxed because now you're just communicating with another human yeah shaky pull up a cheeky i'll allow it though because i'm not in a hurry i'm on a driving test it's fine so a man have you come far for this driving test yeah it took me about an hour and a half to get here this morning yeah see now we're relaxing chill i'm broke in the ice you feel like the ice is broken you chilled out and relaxed now yeah great see awesome that's pretty good so i'm gonna wait until the line's broken and then turn around and double check the mirror there just in case because we do were stationary for a little while so is it right from here then we can go right yeah yeah yeah yeah okay let's make it oh draw me to the bay park we've got this is the car park that they use quite often on driving tests what is this guy doing he's turning,970.16,1021.199,910,197,SsPcN6Ho-ZE,1550,https://youtu.be/SsPcN6Ho-ZE?t=970,
around at every opportunity he's getting jeez geez louise miller signal nice and slow into the car park because we're not in a rush and there might be stuff happening i'm gonna follow the arrows you always need to follow hours in a car park don't disobey road marking even in a car park instantly alright what i'd like you to do here is to forward path into a bay of your choice make sure you finish within the lines please forward parking i can do that and i'm gonna stop just so i can get my thoughts together okay pixabay i'm gonna indicate i'm going to spot my bay reference point and turn in uh straighten up the wheels stop i'm happy to leave it there am i happy to leave it there i might have a little look first okay it's a nice bit of parking okay you're on the line on my side what you're joking no i'm actually not joking the line is allowed you can stop you can,1022.639,1090.08,873,194,SsPcN6Ho-ZE,1550,https://youtu.be/SsPcN6Ho-ZE?t=1022,
be on the line but do you know what oh my god let's reverse that whenever you're ready oh you want me to fix it oh no i'm good we're happy to leave it there okay cool see toy okay off we go loads of observation in the car park because people do weird things in car parks it looks clear one second and then the next second someone's got out of their car and they're walking behind you so out of the car park and a left turn come on g super clear oh your car's so nice the suspension's so good if you can pull over and park up on the left no problem just up here uh on a yellow line okay cool if you're not sure just ask your examiner so this would be considered pulling over somewhere safe okay cancel handbrake with the next instruction all right francis drive off one of you ready all right cool the examiner is going to pull you over like that a few times i'm on the hill so i'm,1092.4,1168.24,880,195,SsPcN6Ho-ZE,1550,https://youtu.be/SsPcN6Ho-ZE?t=1092,
using my biting point can you see that on the pedals yeah you can see that pedal cam kind of comes so good hamburg's off that's so finely balanced i've been a little while now though so i'm going to double check my blow spot look at me taking it seriously so serious a little bit of gas probably don't need it because it's diesel you can settle for the hill without cutting i would i wouldn't i'd always make sure there's more fuel than normal but yeah in diesels you can they're a lot more forgiving right here yeah remember signal position speed i'm definitely not going to cut that corner because i don't know if something's coming around it and i'm on a driving test so i need to pass i'm going to check my mirror i let this learner pass because he was positioned in the middle no one's got priority here because the hazards are on both sides but i'm just thinking of being nice you can never take priority you can only,1170.16,1222.559,923,195,SsPcN6Ho-ZE,1550,https://youtu.be/SsPcN6Ho-ZE?t=1170,
give it so to take control of the situation like a meeting situation like that to take control of it just give the priority because then the other car is going to do exactly what you want we're going to go right at this roundabout okay we have our signal mini roundabout i'm going to approach it really slowly because that man loves that just a slow approach to a junction so isn't that so much nicer are we going uh left from the end left at the end of the road pausing on that signal till i've passed the junction i'm gonna look left and right um obviously you only need to give way to the right on the roundabout but what if there's a police car coming from the left or an ambulance road safety support you need to still look it's important road safety are you at the speed limit oh damn it oh i was so uh busy taking the piss out of you about road safety i forgot my rotating that happened can we edit that,1224.88,1291.919,910,192,SsPcN6Ho-ZE,1550,https://youtu.be/SsPcN6Ho-ZE?t=1224,
let's go back around and we can do that bit again we'll go back around to the copper can i do a handbrake turn i don't know spin around can we do that again no are you gonna put that in yeah damn it take the next road on your left please okay right at the end of the driving test as well this is emmersdale road the driving test center is on this mode jesus [Music] this is gonna make great youtube um [Music] damn [Music] now i've gotta wait six months to book another one well the last one was six months ago i was hoping you'd have improved [Music] has my driving improved i've been taking lots of lessons i've been doing about three lessons every single day take the next road on your right please okay um so my driving should be amazing should we park up on the main road should we park up on the road yeah park up here just pull in park up on the left here there are a cigarette i can use the,1293.2,1353.44,898,203,SsPcN6Ho-ZE,1550,https://youtu.be/SsPcN6Ho-ZE?t=1293,
pavement here but if you're on a driving test and you're not sure ask so the examiner would tell you i want you to go on having that bless you thanks because they will always make sure if there's an exception with that one they will tell you if they want you to go up on the pavement yeah never park on the pavement switch off the engine okay brilliant thank you how did i do give me a few minutes all right francis that's the end of your driving test and unfortunately what you didn't pass on this occasion what what there's quite a few reasons why what yeah the first one being the objective one no i'm not joking the first one being the obvious one um use of speed use of speed you're on a 20 zone going uphill 27 miles per hour damn and i had to tell you to bring it to your attention that did happen that didn't happen um generally your approach yes that would be a fail because i'm way over the speed limit yeah generally your,1355.84,1404.159,932,200,SsPcN6Ho-ZE,1550,https://youtu.be/SsPcN6Ho-ZE?t=1355,
approach to junctions is a little bit too quick one junction where we have that black car on the right the black bmw yeah so that was junction observation because i was expecting petrol acceleration to make sure the car that you're driving capable and kind of yeah i don't like you i said nice things about it but um yeah and then lastly we've also got control on steering on three separate occasions you've taken both hands off the steering wheel yeah yeah one in particular you're 20 miles per hour approaching those traffic lights which now went amber and you sped up to go through i was talking with my hands yeah so there's quite a few things there for you to work on would you fell for taking your hands off the steering wheel there was no loss of control no but considering that the kind of road you're on at the time it wasn't safe i didn't feel safe you didn't feel safe i didn't feel safe that's so funny well you know what there was this examiner yeah,1406.159,1454.0,962,200,SsPcN6Ho-ZE,1550,https://youtu.be/SsPcN6Ho-ZE?t=1406,
and one of my students i've told him plenty of times you know make sure you get both hands on the steering but he'd like to stay with one hand yeah yeah so when he's on his test he's steering with one hand and the other hand is resting here all that he's a new driver but knows what he's doing and the examiner literally goes to him on test i'd feel more comfortable if you use both hands on the steering wow no way so you told him how to steer yeah he told him to put both hands on the steering wheel because he did not you can legit drive with one hand but the examiner didn't feel comfortable with one-handed steering he must have done some dodgy steering yeah well amen i had a lot of fun thank you very much it was good fun definitely for sure i'm gonna have to come back in six months and book another driving test with you by the looks of it but you need to start taking these seriously otherwise you're,1456.24,1496.32,910,194,SsPcN6Ho-ZE,1550,https://youtu.be/SsPcN6Ho-ZE?t=1456,
not gonna get your license at this rate oh i'm gonna lose my license at this rate no um yeah driving super fun amazing if you are learning to drive obviously we're having lots of fun and banter in this video um but the tips that we're telling you are really good really useful make sure that your examiner is impressed have fun with driving but take it seriously drive safe and take it seriously take it seriously yeah take it seriously pass your driving test and then you can go whatever speed you want into any zones joking joking i'm gonna have to take out everything he said in the whole video just don't listen just put some music on in the background but yeah that's the end of the video today hopefully today's video has been useful don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe to francis to see some of his driving at his mock test to see more jokes mock tests yeah great bye for now [Music],1497.76,1549.1,918,186,SsPcN6Ho-ZE,1550,https://youtu.be/SsPcN6Ho-ZE?t=1497,
i know [Music] hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving today i'm doing another mock test with jack now jack you've got your test coming up in about two weeks yeah and this is your first mock test yes jack's had about 25 hours of driving lessons with an instructor but you have had a bit of practice with your parents in your own car all right so you understand what's involved in the mock test do you want me to tell you a little bit about what's going to happen tell me a bit about it yeah okay so throughout the drive i want you to follow the road ahead whenever i need you to turn i will tell you plenty of time for the first sort of 20 minutes or so i'm going to get you to follow the sat nav and then i'm going to give you normal instructions after that i will get you to carry out one maneuver and possibly the emergency stop now before we get started i'm going to ask you a,7.04,63.68,886,193,g9LQDcuZk7A,1629,https://youtu.be/g9LQDcuZk7A?t=7,
quick question could you tell me how would you check that your brakes are working before starting so your brakes are checked kind of they should feel spongy um not no not feel slack or something like that um and if you are actually moving when you do brake you shouldn't get any turning okay all right that's fine all right so um for anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe to the channel if you haven't already and we're gonna go straight into it the sat nav's up and ready yeah i'm just gonna start before you can you see it there's the brightness okay that's fine all right okay so whenever you're ready i'd like you to start the engine now we're going to go down to the very end of this road and the sat nav should start from there so we're making a left turn okay does that break off now yeah just check in [Music] at the end of the road turn left [Music],65.119,150.57,917,199,g9LQDcuZk7A,1629,https://youtu.be/g9LQDcuZk7A?t=65,
jack does have a bit of a habit of crossing his arms over the top of the steering wheel and steering with one hand now this is not a concern as long as you've got good control over the steering wheel [Music] driving along on small residential roads like this always watch out for buses and lorries in good time as there's usually not enough space for both to continue at the same time jack deals with this bus really well by stopping and the bus driver was able to continue we did have priority at this point but the bus driver didn't stop early enough jack deals with the meeting situation well but chooses to go back into first gear on a downhill gradient now the car reacted badly with engine brake in first gear which can be a bit of a surprise to drive his behind so he gets a minor fault for control on gears [Music] turn left v455 [Music] there's still 20 down here that's weird yeah [Music] because it seems really wide for a 20.,155.68,242.159,937,198,g9LQDcuZk7A,1629,https://youtu.be/g9LQDcuZk7A?t=155,
after 200 yards cross the roundabout and take the second exit v455 yeah they've done that to a lot of the roads around in london [Music] cross the roundabout and take the second exit [Music],244.48,264.82,190,44,g9LQDcuZk7A,1629,https://youtu.be/g9LQDcuZk7A?t=244,

after 300 yards go right on the roundabout and take the third exit go right on the roundabout and take the third exit [Music] we're now passing the second exit so at this point jack should check his mirrors towards the left and move into the outside lane towards the second island to take the third exit going the wrong way is not an issue in the driving test just be safe about what you're doing and jack deals with this really well by just going around and taking the fourth exit safely [Music] driving down this road jack gets a minor fault for the following distance with the vehicle in front you should always maintain a two second gap when you're driving above 30 miles per hour a good way to measure this is when the car in front passes a landmark you can use the phrase only a fall breaks a two-second rule again i'm sorry sorry i thought the roundabout would spiral out more but it didn't i was like,354.479,450.24,908,188,g9LQDcuZk7A,1629,https://youtu.be/g9LQDcuZk7A?t=354,

keep driving along normally in that time [Music] when carrying out an emergency stop always make sure to react quickly by moving your foot over to the brake and braking firm to stop quickly even if you don't get the clutch down in time and the engine switches off as you're carrying out the emergency stop this is not a fault jack does put the clutch down first but immediately starts braking he does get a good stop but you should always try and use brake then clutch stop thank you drive off and if you're ready okay i won't be getting you to do that again [Music] turn left [Music] is [Music] oh yeah off okay sorry about that [Music] my indicators in a different place of my car is so used to doing something with that oh my god that's great i think you just keep rolling forward a little bit closer if you can just because we're parking here for a while that'd be great thank you secure the car push for that one and and just switch,1230.159,1339.76,937,198,g9LQDcuZk7A,1629,https://youtu.be/g9LQDcuZk7A?t=1230,
off the engine press the button all right that's the end of your test just give me a few minutes okay i've definitely not passed oh god okay just give me a few minutes okay [Music] all right jack that's the end of your driving test today how was that for you pretty bad i can't lie um part of it was i stalled on that roundabout going up to it i literally jinxed myself a swear because i was like let's do good on the kill start and then i wasn't used to the clutch a hundred percent and i feel like i brought it up too quickly and then i stalled and then the car restarted itself like magic my car doesn't do that but you know so all right well that was a pass how i stalled on the big thing yeah but you moved off successfully and you didn't miss the lights okay you can't let a stall put you off yeah i know i tried but i generally was like i've got to turn the car back on,1342.48,1403.2,876,198,g9LQDcuZk7A,1629,https://youtu.be/g9LQDcuZk7A?t=1342,
and then i was like let's turn the key and there's not a key to turn then i was like the car was on straight away as long as you recover from it quickly yeah that stall was in a bit of a bad spot but luckily for you everyone behind was quite patient nobody who would you nobody tried to overtake you and you recovered quickly so it wasn't a major fault for that okay you did take us around that round about a few times though okay i thought it would spiral out and it just didn't and i was like okay cool i'm going around because it did you just happened to stay on the right for a bit too long i wasn't used to it being so wide i suppose because where i usually am there's just overall you did really well on considering all the roundabouts that i took you on and even on the dual carriageways okay um you know when you made that mistake the first time when you went the wrong way,1405.52,1451.679,881,192,g9LQDcuZk7A,1629,https://youtu.be/g9LQDcuZk7A?t=1405,
and you were like i don't want to make a mistake and you went around that was all right i see a following distance following distance came in there because you got too close with that yeah i know that yeah i just slowed down a bit after but i did i was trying to recover from the roundabout and yeah yeah you kept following them too closely for a little while um besides that you've got your ancillary controls just here the wipers going off crazy i don't know what i did wait i've just just gone like this and it's turned on so i need to maybe go the other way to turn it off yeah i suppose sorry i just yeah that's so good yeah so you've got um your reverse park sorry your bay park you've got a control and observation on that one so because you have to go forward you're going to get a minor fault yeah if you've done it in one it would have been okay um observation because before kind of starting to reverse you did look around,1453.12,1501.36,933,200,g9LQDcuZk7A,1629,https://youtu.be/g9LQDcuZk7A?t=1453,
but as you're reversing you're mainly focusing on the right side this left leg wasn't checked as much okay fair enough now the car park wasn't too busy but just keep checking everywhere and the other one for gears was quite early on there was this encounter with a bus where the bus you went into third gear your driving forward a big double decker bus coming towards you you did slow down and the bus managed to get through now we're going downhill yeah and you switch back into first gear rather than just letting it go in second because you hadn't exactly stopped on that one yeah so the card jolted a bit didn't it it can just be a bit um difficult for drivers behind you because it's without warning they don't realize you're slowing down that much yeah they run into the back of me that's it just keep it in second if you're going like that yeah really not a lot going on for me to mention there with you but yeah so it was a pass,1502.559,1548.32,936,197,g9LQDcuZk7A,1629,https://youtu.be/g9LQDcuZk7A?t=1502,
and i'm not just saying that okay that stall was the only thing that was an issue and then that following distance the rest was all good okay i can't believe that question that nearly nearly had you there at the end of the wipers i was so confused i was absolutely like i'm just gonna make the turn and then deal with it i was like thank god for that yeah because i don't want to do it on a turn or i'll drive into something all right know the whole i drive with one hand yeah a lot of the time my driving instructor says i shouldn't i find i'm doing it when i do this i feel really stiff and like i don't know it's just the general question no i get that with that one i know you kind of kept exchanging between your hands a little bit which is okay as long as you've got good control on your steering it doesn't matter if you do that but some examples might not like it so try,1549.919,1597.2,878,193,g9LQDcuZk7A,1629,https://youtu.be/g9LQDcuZk7A?t=1549,
yeah both hands and if you take one off briefly it's not an issue as long as there's no control loss then they can't exactly fault you on that cool okay all right so that's the end of your mock test really well done thank you okay all right so that's the end of our mock test today hopefully that video has been useful as you can see jack did take us off the track a few times there but he dealt with it safely which is which is the key thing here [Laughter] all right thank you bye for now bye [Music],1598.4,1628.16,502,113,g9LQDcuZk7A,1629,https://youtu.be/g9LQDcuZk7A?t=1598,

hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving today i'm doing another mock test with courtney now this is the first time we're driving together now you have done a test before um and you've all your tests have been in the space of kind of four months i think it was yeah um so what happened on the test you get a bit nervous you said yeah it's just like test nerves are really not helping so would you say it's because you feel like you've made a mistake and you have to sort of carry on does that play a part um and i think just in general i just get like before i've even started it just really doesn't help okay you're gonna be okay with this today yeah that's okay yeah all right okay so um for anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe to the channel if you haven't already and select that bell icon so you get a notification whenever i upload a video,30.48,78.96,911,195,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=30,
all right so i'm going to give you instructions and then get you to follow some directions as well yeah now you know what's involved in the test so i want you to keep following the road ahead whenever you don't know where you're going you can always ask okay but i will tell you in plenty of time if i don't say anything just go ahead yeah i will get you to do one maneuver okay all right so we're in isaac today which is where you have done one of your tests yeah okay all right so is there anything missing oh yeah okay so i'll give you a quick question before we start so could you tell me how would you check if your power assisted steering was working or not um it shouldn't um the steering wheel shouldn't feel heavy it should feel um actually if it wasn't working it it would feel heavy and yeah okay that's fine okay you have to have the engine on to test it yeah okay yeah yeah okay all right so when you're,81.119,135.52,916,197,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=81,
ready we're gonna get started,137.12,137.12,29,6,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=137,
there you go one more thing you've got to do just turn off the handbrake when you get a chance okay it's so confusing there you go all right when you're ready nice and relaxed [Music],154.8,180.83,183,43,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=154,
at the roundabout turn right it's the second exit [Music],204.4,207.79,57,14,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=204,
when driving down these roads courtney leaves a really good clearance all around her vehicle as she's coming up to the black car that's parked on the left she moves over to the right in good time leaving at least one meter of clearance from the car [Music],238.159,257.76,256,53,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=238,
so [Music] i'd like you to pull over and park on the left somewhere safe [Music] i think you'd drive that's gonna be ready [Music] and at the roundabout and left is the first exit on approach to the park van ahead courtney ends up waiting for the bus as there's not enough space to continue she stops a little bit too close so she wasn't able to continue when there was enough space now this wouldn't get counted as a fault but it's always a good idea to wait at least two columns away [Music] so [Music] so [Music],275.52,389.49,515,121,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=275,
you can pull over and park up on the left somewhere safe [Music] oh thank you drive often if you're ready whenever you're moving on from a park position you need to always check towards the road and look over your shoulder courtney gets another minor fault for moving off safety as she's not checking her right blind spot as the road is really wide we couldn't actually see the right hand side of the road so if a motorbike or a car was moving off from the opposite side of the road we would not have seen [Music] them right courtney when it's safe to do so i'd like you to demonstrate how you would wash the front windscreen [Music] thank you [Music] when driving along on a road with parked cars on the right hand side always be aware that you need to position more towards the left as the vehicles opposite need to use the middle of the road and come over the center line courtney does this really well by,409.039,492.479,908,193,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=409,
positioning and keeping a good clearance all round at the end and left first exit [Music],494.0,502.32,89,19,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=494,
so [Music] okay if you can pull it and park up on the left just before the next parked car okay don't worry about the drives anyway anywhere along here is fine [Music] that'd be great though thank you okay we're going to start the independent driving from here so i'm going to give you a series of directions to follow okay when you go down this road and you get to the next sorry when you go down this road and you get to the first roundabout i'd like you to turn right it's the full exit okay and then follow signs to hounslow from there okay so could you just repeat that back to me so when i get to the end of this road turn right and the fourth exit and follow the signs to house perfect if you forget you can ask okay yeah okay,542.08,605.519,733,162,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=542,
[Music],627.32,627.32,7,3,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=627,
approaching the traffic light junction ahead there's a sign on the left hand side which indicates that hounds low is towards the right courtney doesn't realize and she gets into the lane that's going straight ahead [Music] sorry so just to confirm on my gun straight um yeah we're just safe from here yeah okay so we have actually missed the signs yeah i think yeah what i'd like you to do now on this round right so we're gonna make a u-turn take the fourth exit okay [Music],703.2,755.01,476,103,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=703,
going the wrong way is not a problem so always make sure to stay calm if you know you're headed the wrong way and the examiner will redirect you on approach to this roundabout courtney should have indicated right on approach but this wasn't an issue as she did put it on before she started turning she does a roundabout really nicely and uses her mirrors to move back towards the left to exit so still following signs to hounslow to the left from these traffic lights [Music],774.639,806.38,475,97,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=774,
so [Music] so [Music],823.44,838.2,21,8,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=823,
on approach to this next mini roundabout hounslow is signposted towards the right if you're unsure or you've forgotten it's a good idea to ask the examiner in good time if you're too close to the roundabout and you ask the examiner they'll usually say do what you think is safe [Music],877.519,893.47,285,64,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=877,
all right we've missed the signs on that one okay it was actually a right turn um if you can just turn left after this van okay [Music] okay we're just coming up to the car park we'll do a maneuver in here so um just drive up to the very end and turn right [Music] i'd like you to forward park into the space of your choice you can go around the block there's a few more spaces on the other side,940.639,988.0,395,92,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=940,
[Music] um you happy to leave it there um if i reverse it so i'm confused of how to reverse it um up left down there it is in order to finish within the white lines always remember to look all around and reverse back the length of your car that way you can use the lines in front of you to guide your bonnet and turn in the direction you need to move courtney doesn't reverse back enough which makes it harder for her to park,1016.8,1066.08,425,93,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=1016,
okay i'm not happy with this but i'm gonna change it before starting to reverse always remember to look over both blind spots left and right courtney does not check her left blind spot this car park has a one-way system so if somebody was approaching they would be approaching from our left,1082.24,1112.08,290,57,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=1082,
okay i'm just gonna leave it like that okay all right reverse that whenever you're ready so,1153.76,1172.08,91,19,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=1153,
just stop that's just yeah just just when you get to the end you can sort it out like here yeah just sort it out [Music] all right we're just going to turn left and leave the car park now thank you when driving around and turning in a car park it's always a good idea to use your indicators as pedestrians may not realize which way you intend to go go right [Music],1208.88,1264.27,365,81,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=1208,
and left at the roundabout [Music],1290.159,1293.68,34,9,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=1290,
courtney does have really good spatial awareness when it comes to dealing with meeting situations with the road ahead parked cars on both sides she's leaving enough clearance from the left as well as allowing enough space in the middle of the road for oncoming traffic [Music] if you can pull it and park up on the left just after these two cars just in this space here yeah it doesn't have to be perfect don't worry [Music] that's great there thank you all right so drive off whenever you're ready i'm just going to give you normal instructions from now on okay [Music],1324.88,1374.35,570,118,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=1324,
around about turn right it's the third exit [Music],1403.679,1406.47,51,12,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=1403,
courtney gets marked down for hesitation at this roundabout as the bus and the traffic from the left was blocking the vehicle on the right and we could have entered,1431.84,1438.559,164,32,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=1431,

you can pull it and park up on the left hand side along here [Music] that's great thank you and just secure the car just switch off the engine as well all right brilliant that's the end of your test give me a few minutes right so how was the drive for you um it was a lot different because um i'm so used to my car so this is like different so i'm getting used to it and but i enjoyed it but it was just i know there's like a little things that yeah now overall you did well but unfortunately it wouldn't be past okay and do you know why that is um was it because of the the four bay maneuver yeah what happened in it um i i wasn't in the lines yeah you knew that i knew it but i didn't know how to i sort of knew how to correct it but then like i was kind of nervous so i just thought i'm just going to give up yeah i,1597.679,1669.279,818,189,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=1597,
shouldn't have done that i should have actually it did it did take two shots already so by the by the third the examiner would usually be like no but you know happy to leave it there that's fine they're not even gonna ask you by the third one okay because it's already taken too long yeah um so sorry just to ask so you get three attempts with just that all it depends i would say let's say two shunts yeah to fix it and you had two and then it was a third by that time it's also depending on how long it takes you as well so you can't have the amount of time so you can't be there for ages and ages for that just yeah okay um so with that particular maneuver you did get two serious faults okay one for your control because you weren't in the space the second one was for your observation so this happened in the maneuver when you started reversing you'd initially kind of look to the right yeah and start reversing and then as you're reversing,1670.88,1718.159,945,201,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=1670,
you're looking left so you're not looking left before yeah okay so i need to look before yeah and during them that's it so what happened there is initially you just got a miner for not looking around and then when you reversed out right at the end yeah there was a dangerous fault yeah yeah there was that black learner car coming yeah and that's what it went up into a serious fault so they're coming round and you're reversing and halfway through reversing you've looked yeah and they already haven't seen yeah i'm too close yeah okay so that's that's that maneuver there besides that um a few things i know the gears might be the the car there because you kind of went into three installed four installs you've just got to keep it to the left um there's moving off safety this happened quite early on so when you moved off on the first two stops you didn't really check your blind spot at all yeah you did later on yeah but the,1719.6,1763.36,930,191,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=1719,
first two you didn't check at all okay um you're very hesitant on roundabouts now that went into that nearly went into a serious fault okay so did you realize you were being a bit closer i was yeah i think because i do my other tests i've been sort of tried to go sometimes too early and then causes me to get a major okay so like i'm trying to be like i don't want to go too soon but i don't obviously hold up traffic too so so the times that you have been hesitant it was on on one of them it was at the very beginning so you're probably a little bit nervous so when we get to the first round about it kind of looks like a t-junction yeah there was nobody to your right but there's vehicles to your left yeah you got there and you're just looking left and they're waiting for you and you're waiting for there yeah so that's why it went into okay well why are we waiting yeah and then later on we,1765.84,1810.48,897,199,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=1765,
had um a vehicle on the right yeah yes we give way to them but then there's a bus in front yeah and that bus what do they do yeah they they come forward and they completely blocked the car didn't they yeah and you just carried on waiting and i thought oh that was a really big gap yeah yeah so we got to make sure we take these opportunities to get going you are really confident with driving with with your pedals the gears and stuff you do change gears quite quickly which is great so it's just kind of little things that i need like probably my nerves i just need to get more confident with yeah you just need to keep practicing like you said you've had an issue with observation yeah so you're being a little bit cautious yeah but now you're being overly cautious so you want to find that middle ground with that one okay how many miners did i actually get in total miners i've got a few advisories in there so you've got one two three four five six seven eight nine ten,1813.12,1858.159,974,201,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=1813,
eleven twelve oh okay so there's a few miners yeah so just that's it so it was just one major two okay and then it's both for your maneuver but besides that i was kind of worried about your hesitation a little bit okay okay yeah that's that's that's the main things there okay okay yeah well thank you for doing that with me that's nice to know where i'm going this way you'll be able to watch your driving yeah yeah i've never watched it yeah so it's nice to do that all right well that's the end of our mock test today hopefully that video has been useful for you guys as well don't forget to like comment and subscribe to the channel bye for now [Music],1860.96,1897.9,656,145,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=1860,

[Music] and let's turn right this junction has a fairly narrow entrance so as we're waiting at the end there was a vehicle approaching from the left who wanted to turn into the same road so as we're waiting they decided to give way and wait for us to come out of the road first [Music] leading up to this right bend with the part vehicles on the right ishvin positions more towards the left which allows more space in the center of the road for oncoming traffic when somebody does turn up she doesn't need to move as she's already in a good position so we're turning left from here i don't know why this like that's not speaking i will sort that out,124.03,182.879,649,140,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=124,
if you can pull over and park up on the left just behind the silver car but leave enough space to move away don't worry about the driveways on this occasion okay so just keep going forward a little bit more about a car's length in front okay that'd be great there thank you all right whenever you're ready let's drive off,211.04,227.68,321,68,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=211,
[Music],249.06,249.06,7,3,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=249,
turn left then take the second right on approach for this left turn ishvin doesn't go round towards the left enough so as she moves out of this junction she naturally turns slightly wider going over the center line of the new road resulting in a minor for steering control [Music] 200 yards turn right turn right on approach to this right cent is being positioned really close to the center line so the vehicles behind were not interrupted and they were able to continue past on the left always make sure that you're not crossing the center line when you're waiting for a right turn,265.84,328.479,582,114,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=265,
if you can pull over and park up on the left somewhere safe,353.6,354.96,59,13,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=353,
that's great thank you drive off when you're ready so [Music] at the end of the road turn right then cross the roundabout and take the second exit as nobody was affected with the signal timing it wasn't a big issue but always aim to indicate about six to eight car lengths away as we're only traveling on a residential road 20 miles per hour if we were traveling at a faster speed you can signal earlier cross the roundabout and take the second exit is really good awareness and planning she slows down really well with the mini roundabout as it's very closed you can't see on either side until you're right at the end this also makes it easier for her to deal with the bus ahead so she gives the bus a lot of clearance to get out through the narrow gap and then to continue,373.28,473.599,774,162,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=373,
[Music] after 150 yards cross the roundabout and take the second exit then turn left cross the roundabout and take the second exit then turn left it's not here by the way it's at the end of this road when traveling downhill the car will naturally pick up speed so you should always use the foot brake in order to control the speed of the vehicle to avoid going over the speed limit although it means not excessively over the speed limit it did feel too fast considering the number of potential hazards and the space available so you should always drive a reasonable speed according to what's happening on the road [Music] turn left,514.45,578.24,631,125,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=514,
um after 150 yards turn left a40 at the end of the road turn left [Music] turn left,596.8,625.36,83,22,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=596,
ishmaen gets a minor fault for not signaling when joining this dual carriageway although there's nowhere for us to go at this point it's always a good idea to indicate to alert others of your presence,642.88,652.24,200,43,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=642,
once on the dual carriageway you should always make sure that you've got at least a two second gap from the vehicle in front ishveen is travelling much closer than this so gets a minor fault for following distance traveling down this road you can see that the line that divides the left and the middle lane almost starts to become a solid line this is because the left hand lane is now coming off the dual carriageway if you wanted to continue ahead you would now need to move into the middle lane which is the normal driving position for going straight ahead after 300 yards go around the roundabout and take the fourth exit towards central london go around the roundabout and take the fourth exit as there was enough space for the emergency vehicle to go around from the left we didn't need to slow down or move out of the way in this case so this was not an issue as we went round the roundabout ishvin starts using her mirrors to spiral,667.76,754.639,940,194,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=667,
outwards to take the fourth exit but accidentally moves over and takes the third exit now as the roundabout was clear and nobody was affected by this this would not be counted as a fault but you should always count the exits as you're going round take the exit then we've just gone the wrong way now so i'm going to give you directions as normal from now on okay turn around when possible just ignore the sun at the end of the road turn right after 100 yards turn left then turn around when possible turn left then turn around when possible just continue driving ahead i'm going to give you normal directions turn around when possible then at the end of the road turn right turn around when possible then turn left [Music] okay we're going to be making a right turn soon,756.48,836.16,770,155,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=756,
[Music] so we're turning right in there okay,852.34,858.16,44,11,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=852,
and then turn left please so,880.079,892.079,28,6,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=880,
on approach for the width restriction ahead ishbin does get a serious fault for use of speed as she doesn't slow down enough for the narrow gap ahead the left hand tire does hit the pavement just like that slow down that's i hit the front tire there just slow it down please just slow it down slow it down that's i hit the front tire there just slow it down please just keep the wheel straight keep the wheel straight just go slowly keep keep the wheel straight there sorry that did hit the tire okay take the next road,907.36,957.519,519,106,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=907,
[Music] it's a 20 zone okay [Music] traveling behind this blue car is another minor fault for following distance as she's keeping too close now if the vehicle in front was to suddenly stop or break at any point we would have very little time to react so you should always try to maintain a good distance so that you can stop within the distance you see to be clear aim to have at least two seconds when you're traveling above 30 miles per hour but otherwise you want to be able to stop within the distance you see to be clear,980.37,1028.88,525,111,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=980,
approaching the cyclists ahead now you should only overtake a cyclist if it's safe and necessary in this case it was necessary to overtake but it wasn't safe due to the bend ahead so ishmaen should have kept a bigger distance from the cyclist and not got too close ishmaen does hold off from overtaking but should try to maintain a bigger distance from the cyclist so that they don't feel scared that we're too close behind them when you can see the road ahead clearly and it's safe to do so you should check your mirrors and overtake the cyclist [Music] okay well it's safe to do so i'd like you to demonstrate how you would open the window,1047.839,1097.12,641,138,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=1047,
thank you at the roundabout i'd like you to follow the road ahead it's the second exit on approach to this next roundabout ishbin does make a serious fault with response to road markings as she gets into the left only lane and follows the road ahead once in this position she should have simply turned left and not follow the road ahead going the wrong way is never a fault but you can't go against the road markings as it's dangerous for others around you,1117.52,1148.08,456,94,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=1117,
so,1173.44,1173.44,2,1,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=1173,
[Music] turn left please,1193.38,1196.559,24,6,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=1193,
at the end turn right [Music],1231.039,1244.65,29,8,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=1231,
thank you if you can pull over and park up on the right hand side of the road please don't worry about the drives on this occasion yeah ishmael deals with the oncoming van really nicely by slowing down and making sure she's not cutting across their path and allowing them to pass on the right before going across to the right hand side of the road that's great though thank you what i'd like you to do now is to reverse back for about two car lengths keeping a reasonable distance from the pavement and try not to touch the curb as you do this before starting to reverse ishmaen does look all around checking from her right blind spot all the way around towards the left in towards the road but as she's reversing she's mainly checking her right mirror and looking towards the road and her left blind spot she's not checking her right blind spot as she's reversing this does go down as a minor fault this would go down as a serious fault if,1268.799,1328.48,940,192,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=1268,
somebody had stepped into the road from her right blind spot from one of the houses on the right hand side as that area is not covered in the right hand mirror just a little bit more thank you drive off when you're ready,1330.4,1350.32,220,46,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=1330,
when parked on the right hand side of the road it is very difficult to see the road ahead so you should always lean across towards the left trying to see the road as best as possible if there's anyone oncoming always wait for the road to be clear as you need to cross their path and move across towards the left hand side of the road,1366.159,1381.12,333,69,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=1366,
turn left piece,1398.32,1398.32,15,3,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=1398,
that's great i think if you can just pull over and park up on the left just after the speed bumble we find just over here on the road okay that's great there thank you just just here that's brilliant i think you secure the car and you can switch off the engine as well just turn off the indicator all right that is the end of your driving test how was the drive it was good yeah do you think there were any serious mistakes uh one there were a few actually um i'm gonna go over them with you now all right so unfortunately it wouldn't be a pass okay and i know you you know the obvious one where i had to grab the steering right okay now besides that there were a few other things and at first it was just minor faults but because what this one thing kept happening over and over again and this is something we have talked about the box following distance first of all how you know when someone's driving a little bit,1418.08,1472.48,917,190,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=1418,
slower and then you kind of catch up to them yeah that happened a few times didn't it yeah you need to drop back so that happened once on the a road then it happened a little bit later with that blue car and the cyclist was there um yeah you were a little bit too fast with the speed bumps you noticed that as well okay um the other thing was when we went on that roundabout i know we went the wrong way that was okay you did check but it was quite a big movement we were on the fourth lane and we've jumped over all the way to the left okay so that one mirror check it's not safe to just kind of get you all the way to the left lane like that okay now there was a there's so much going on i'm trying to think of the main ones to talk about here so obviously that works restriction did you realize how narrow that was you know those pillars oh yeah yeah yeah because i had to grab the wheel at that,1473.76,1518.96,898,196,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=1473,
point so as you're going into it i know you did slow down but you didn't slow down enough yeah because as soon as we went the wrong way i was like shoot we're going to have the width restriction this way oh okay because if you had if you hadn't gone off track then we would just get get back on the road and yeah but yeah going the wrong way wasn't the problem it was kind of the width restriction and you know that second police car that we had yeah okay so they're coming up behind you and i just thought let me help you out and i said okay we'll move over left at this point now i know i said move left but as soon as i've said that you've just moved left without checking now it was clear but you can't rely on me checking for you for the police one yeah i did check them right the second one yeah for the second one i'll have to check it back um it's just a movement to the left it just felt like sudden to me yeah then,1520.32,1562.48,924,206,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=1520,
there was the maneuver reversing back for two car lengths now that okay so with the maneuver parking on the right reversing back you dealt with the van in front really nicely so you knew you couldn't pull across this path so you kind of waited which was nice you let him through you've checked and moved over the reversing back for two columns was nice just your right blind spot i know you were checking it initially but then when that other car came and parked that behind your focus kind of became on the left and here and that mirror but you didn't check your right as much which is when i said continue reversing because i wanted you to check over your shoulder one more time okay but no otherwise that maneuver was good but yeah mainly the issues were your following distance a few occasions you did go over the 20 zone about 22-24 and it was just a bit too quick especially with the speed bumps okay um but mainly that which restriction was the big big issue there and um,1566.159,1618.799,978,193,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=1566,
what else is there you dealt with the philly at first oh you dealt with the first ambulance really well but you just needed to kind of make a decision so if we went forward a little bit quicker they can get out the way around us aren't they yeah um what else do i think i'm forgetting some things oh yes how can i forget this another major fault that we had is we came up to lady margaret roundabout and i said to you follow the road ahead second exit you went into a left only lane and you went straight oh did you realize no idea yeah so coming up to that um there's a clear left arrow in our lane and in the other lane there's a straight arrow so if you know you're going straight you should have been on the right now at first i just thought okay maybe she's gonna just turn left from here and i just sat there didn't say anything but then as we went forward someone turned up on your right little white car yeah,1620.32,1671.12,916,196,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=1620,
and they went forward and then you kind of checked and moved in behind but don't do that you're in the wrong lane okay so what should we do in that position turn right turn left all right all right yeah yeah so we should not have gone straight from that lane so i'm saying there's a few things that happened like the first half of the test was really good there really wasn't much going on but then as soon as we got to the second half a few things happened kind of one off the other one of them was you know when we joined the uh dual carriageway yeah you didn't have a right signal oh so as we were joining there were a few cars and they're kind of in front of you now so behind them there wasn't really anyone close so your signal wasn't a big issue there because nobody was close but now let's say we had another car coming up they know you're coming in but just that signal really brings it to their,1672.88,1720.88,904,196,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=1672,
attention yeah okay so yeah that's the end of our mock test video today hopefully that video has been useful i know there was a lot of mistakes but we've got time to correct this as well so don't don't stress about it okay all right thank you and bye for now [Music],1722.159,1736.54,266,59,4tdsVo7UmZU,1738,https://youtu.be/4tdsVo7UmZU?t=1722,

hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving today i'm doing a mock test with robert hello now this is the first time we're driving together and you've only had four hours driving lessons yes but besides that you have been driving with a friend and you've got a lot of road experience being on a bike so that definitely helps but you've never done a mock test before no okay all right so um i'm going to tell you a little bit about the test so throughout the drive i want you to follow the road ahead whenever i need you to turn i will tell you if i don't if i don't say anything keep going straight i'm going to get you to do one maneuver and maybe even the emergency stop okay probably not with the helmet in the back though um any questions before we get started okay all right so before we get started i'm gonna ask you a quick question can you tell me where do you find the information for the recommended tire,28.88,75.92,916,191,8ei2WUQn1nk,1585,https://youtu.be/8ei2WUQn1nk?t=28,
pressure and how do you check this you find a on the um manufactured guide okay and you check it with the [Music] label um really readable um oh it's good i know what you're saying worry a reliable pressure yeah yeah that's right so that's okay all right for anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe to the channel if you haven't already and select that bell icon so you get a notification every time i upload on youtube alright so when you're ready robert i'd like you to start the engine okay [Music] all right then we'll drive off whenever you're ready okay [Music],77.6,137.14,624,133,8ei2WUQn1nk,1585,https://youtu.be/8ei2WUQn1nk?t=77,
at the end of the road turn left please as we're driving down this road robert speed suddenly slows down which can be an issue as other vehicles may unnecessarily start to overtake you always drive up to the speed of the road when it's safe to do so [Music] and at the end of this row turn right [Music],156.959,197.22,303,67,8ei2WUQn1nk,1585,https://youtu.be/8ei2WUQn1nk?t=156,
leading up to the zebra crossing ahead robert nearly gets a serious fault for his response to the pedestrian approaching from the left now we did have to break quite sharp but as robert had been checking his mirrors regularly and nobody was close behind this did not go down as a serious fault but you should always scan zebra crossings and step off the accelerator as pedestrians have priority here [Music],283.44,308.04,407,76,8ei2WUQn1nk,1585,https://youtu.be/8ei2WUQn1nk?t=283,
traffic lights turn by please,334.72,334.72,29,5,8ei2WUQn1nk,1585,https://youtu.be/8ei2WUQn1nk?t=334,
when waiting in the middle of a junction to make a right turn always make sure that the front of your vehicle is not on the opposite side of the road as this will obstruct the path of oncoming traffic as robert's waiting he is slightly overhanging but as nobody turned up in this lane this did not go down as a serious fault,352.08,368.4,324,68,8ei2WUQn1nk,1585,https://youtu.be/8ei2WUQn1nk?t=352,
so [Music],386.4,392.43,10,4,8ei2WUQn1nk,1585,https://youtu.be/8ei2WUQn1nk?t=386,
at the roundabout turn left is the first exit,419.599,421.759,45,10,8ei2WUQn1nk,1585,https://youtu.be/8ei2WUQn1nk?t=419,
[Music] at the roundabout right it's the second exit,440.39,455.759,52,13,8ei2WUQn1nk,1585,https://youtu.be/8ei2WUQn1nk?t=440,
at the traffic lights approaching the right turn at the traffic lights there are two lanes that turn right robert goes into the overtaking lane now starting in the overtaking lane is not a problem as long as you turn in the overtaking lane and you're up to the speed of the road you should just try and move back into the left hand lane when safe [Music] once on the dual carriageway robert is checking his mirrors but he's not signaling left this way nobody in the middle lane realizes he's intending to move over even if you can't move over you should still leave your signal running that way the vehicles behind you know that you intend to move into that lane and you should always keep up to the speed of the road when trying to switch lanes,487.52,532.0,745,153,8ei2WUQn1nk,1585,https://youtu.be/8ei2WUQn1nk?t=487,
next traffic light junction turn right keys robert demonstrates really good mirror checks when trying to change lanes always check the top mirror and then the side mirror in the direction you intend to move when checking your mirrors make sure the vehicle next to you is visible in the top mirror and that your speed is matching if you can see them in the top it's safe to move over lanes when approaching this junction to make this right turn the front right of the car is slightly over the white line the traffic on the opposite side is on a 40 miles per hour road so if somebody was in that first lane they could be up to 40 so it's not safe for us to overhang this line you should always wait behind the white line [Music] if you can pull over and park up on the left somewhere safe i think you drive up and if you're ready,549.04,622.16,827,170,8ei2WUQn1nk,1585,https://youtu.be/8ei2WUQn1nk?t=549,
[Music] take the road on your legs [Music] for some sharp turns robert does use one hand on the steering wheel and spins his hand over the top of the steering wheel and lets the steering slide through his fingers now as long as you don't actually lose grip of the steering wheel this is not a fault but if you get sweaty hands or your hand simply slips off the steering at any point this will be a serious fault so always try and use both hands on the steering wheel for better control [Music] when dealing with meeting situations always try and time your approach so that you're not having to keep stopping and starting robert does this really well as he's moving his position towards the left or right he's aware of his mirrors and he's checking top and left or top and right as he's moving back into the road [Music] if you can pull over and park on the right hand side of the road please don't worry about the drives on this one,641.67,731.76,932,194,8ei2WUQn1nk,1585,https://youtu.be/8ei2WUQn1nk?t=641,
it's fine it's okay on the other line as well okay that's great there okay robert what i'd like you to do now is to reverse back for two car lengths keeping a reasonable distance from the pavement okay and try not to touch the curb as you're doing this okay,733.92,750.959,257,56,8ei2WUQn1nk,1585,https://youtu.be/8ei2WUQn1nk?t=733,
before starting any reversing exercise you need to check over your blind spots as these areas are not covered in your mirrors robert does not check his right blind spot before reversing this section of the road was actually a fence and there were no entrances on the right so this did not go down as a serious fault he can see in the camera that there's no one behind on either side so he was making sure it was clear but you shouldn't rely on this and you should look over both blind spots when moving off from a parked position on the right it's always better to look from your right blind spot and finish looking over into your left blind spot so that your final check is towards the road,773.04,811.12,691,136,8ei2WUQn1nk,1585,https://youtu.be/8ei2WUQn1nk?t=773,
[Music],838.56,838.56,7,3,8ei2WUQn1nk,1585,https://youtu.be/8ei2WUQn1nk?t=838,

turn left please [Music],906.8,909.15,24,6,8ei2WUQn1nk,1585,https://youtu.be/8ei2WUQn1nk?t=906,
robert has really good spatial awareness with the space around his vehicle as he's driving whenever the road is narrow he steps off the accelerator and positioned so that he's in the center of the space if you're unsure of the space it's better to brake so you have more control when dealing with the narrow gap ahead let the traffic lights turn right please [Music],949.04,986.29,366,73,8ei2WUQn1nk,1585,https://youtu.be/8ei2WUQn1nk?t=949,

you can pull over involved on the left somewhere safe i think driver's gonna be ready,1082.16,1094.64,85,17,8ei2WUQn1nk,1585,https://youtu.be/8ei2WUQn1nk?t=1082,
[Music] driving down this road robert leaves a lot of clearance around his vehicle the center of the car is in the center of the road so the driver is just on the right of the center line and the passenger is just to the left this way you've got plenty of clearance in case anybody swings their door open as you're driving through [Music] so [Music],1115.8,1159.55,349,75,8ei2WUQn1nk,1585,https://youtu.be/8ei2WUQn1nk?t=1115,
turn left at the roundabout [Music] and then turn left again [Music] turn right from him robert demonstrates really good moving off on an uphill gradient he's pressing the accelerator and keeping the clutch steady until he's moving off safely turn left,1176.32,1235.44,252,49,8ei2WUQn1nk,1585,https://youtu.be/8ei2WUQn1nk?t=1176,
[Music] and if you can just put it in park up on the left in this space here just behind the van just take it a little bit slower in case he reverses not too close sorry don't want to test it all right um yeah that'd be great there thank you secure and switch off the engine okay brilliant that's the end of your test give me a few minutes don't speak all right well that would be a pass but there was just that one fault at the very beginning oh do you remember the zebra crossing man oh yeah yeah yeah that could have played out so differently had somebody been behind us yeah no because no one was behind you got a minor fault right but imagine someone was behind you know the way we break there yeah yeah so we need to always have a slightly slower approach in case you know the man's there he might cross yeah he might walk past but we need to be prepared either way and you suddenly saw him otherwise that,1258.91,1333.44,911,192,8ei2WUQn1nk,1585,https://youtu.be/8ei2WUQn1nk?t=1258,
would have been a serious fault straight away okay so that was the only one unfortunately that kind of little brain besides that you yeah you're going to um yeah it's because no one was behind us on that one i said i'm lucky yeah but you know just be a bit more careful with that yeah um besides that i want to talk about how you position for turning right sometimes so on two separate occasions when we're turning right you kind of go into position to turn right but then your front goes a little bit over okay and then i'm concerned you know like when we were turning by hounds low bus garage yeah when we were turning this the blue car i think it was flash their lights okay now imagine that the blue car was approaching a bit faster yeah if he wanted to continue in a straight line could he continue without having to swerve you you know like go around yeah so that's why i've gone a bit too yeah so make sure if there's a center line that when you're turning right that,1335.28,1394.32,974,202,8ei2WUQn1nk,1585,https://youtu.be/8ei2WUQn1nk?t=1335,
you're not going over the center you want to be right next to it but not crossing it because the car happened to give way and plus the lights were kind of probably changing on their side as well which helped yeah but yeah just be mindful of how you're positioning yeah now your general drive is really nice like even when you were on the um a4 you knew you had to move left yeah yeah just that's the thing i had the the two cars left so i didn't want to interview in him so i said i will move to the left whenever it's safe so when you moved into that road you were quite confident speeding up which was nice but then as you got into that road you kind of started trying to move left but yeah but i saw that van gaal i wanted i was waiting for him to you know go or true but with that one if you if you're waiting to for them to move over and kind of don't let your speed drop,1395.36,1441.52,876,193,8ei2WUQn1nk,1585,https://youtu.be/8ei2WUQn1nk?t=1395,
because you're looking your speed went a bit slower at that point so just check signal even if you can't move over just let them know right because then at least they can make a bit more of a judgement call as well okay um you're reversing on the right great control but your observation you looked around before reversing but as you're reversing you're kind of using your mirrors not your blind spots so keep checking blind spots as you're reversing and there was a car that passed us in the road yeah make sure to stop when somebody passes you okay because he's quite quick and because you didn't have to do any steering it was like a little minor but try not to reverse when there are people passing you because even a little bit of steering and your car is going to swing right yeah so yeah remember to stop so you've got a minor fault for your observation on that one because you weren't looking around while reversing but again let's say you're reversing and,1444.159,1496.08,964,192,8ei2WUQn1nk,1585,https://youtu.be/8ei2WUQn1nk?t=1444,
now somebody does turn up because you're not checking your blind spots it's now serious yeah so you see how these little things can develop yeah but yeah the biggest concern was obviously just the pedestrians yeah well good luck because no one's behind me yeah but you just gotta make sure that you're kind of scanning yeah overall really nice driving like you know what was it nervous yeah the very beginning yeah but no overall you you do drive really well really confident on the big roads getting up to speeds using your mirrors all the time no issues with all that and on the 20 roads you're making sure not to let it go over yeah um obviously i know these roads so it made it easier yeah i thought your testers here that's why and lastly um on the 20 road you stayed in second gear the whole time in the 20 bro yeah okay it's better to be in third gear yeah you know how to control third yeah so i would have suggested yet going just for,1498.08,1553.2,943,194,8ei2WUQn1nk,1585,https://youtu.be/8ei2WUQn1nk?t=1498,
fuel efficiency now that's not something the examiner is going to mark you down on i know but for yourself yeah okay also stay with the clutch while you're waiting at the real life usually i go in neutral yeah you can do that yeah you can do that in the test as well yeah yeah all right well that's the end of your test today hopefully this will be useful for you to look definitely kind of reflect on yeah but yeah thank you for everyone that's been watching today's video hopefully that video has been useful for you guys as well don't forget to like the video comment and subscribe [Music],1555.12,1583.22,592,121,8ei2WUQn1nk,1585,https://youtu.be/8ei2WUQn1nk?t=1555,
just be careful of that white car but you're following behind the black cab that's not your fault that's not your fault he's in the wrong though yeah okay this is quite small so what do we do stop break and break hands [Music] hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving today i'm doing a driving lesson with simon so this is the first time we're driving after the mock test yes now how was it driving in the mock test or watching your video it was very horrible and i'm very salute to your passion about your gearbox and after so many comments but at least you you kind of you can see yeah i see where i was wrong and where is my weak point now i will work on my yeah so we've already been driving uh for the last little 15-20 minutes or so we've driven here and the brakes and the clutch and the gears have been really good we've had no issues so far and,0.32,66.4,858,189,oCdP6rjD8UM,1548,https://youtu.be/oCdP6rjD8UM?t=0,
you've been really nice with the gearbox so yeah so today's lesson we're just going to address some of the other issues and your main concern is roundabouts and roundabouts yeah so roundabouts and gears so that's what we're going to go and work on now so it's going to be a normal lesson where i'm going to just kind of watch what you're doing and then give you any feedback on the go and if there's any big issues we're going to address them and you also instruct me yeah so just normal lesson like you would have yeah okay all right so if anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe if you haven't already and don't forget to select that bell icon to get a notification every time that i upload on youtube are you ready yes alright so when you're ready let's start there you go so when you're ready let's go,68.799,116.719,862,186,oCdP6rjD8UM,1548,https://youtu.be/oCdP6rjD8UM?t=68,
that's good good now we're gonna speed up really quickly before we change gears okay okay no i can't change [Music] so remember we were talking about the middle of the windscreen so the blue marker come over to the pavement and keep it [Music] that there good already so straight away if you check that left mirror you can see we've got a good distance so it's not too far is it doing too much yeah [Music] so you've learned not to go back into first gear yeah yeah no not until you're extremely slow or you're going uphill okay really nice distance again maintain it good [Music],139.76,208.34,580,126,oCdP6rjD8UM,1548,https://youtu.be/oCdP6rjD8UM?t=139,
all right you see the car in front i want you to position just like the car so kind of get yourself behind the driver brake clutch we're not going to do what he's doing we're going to stay here there is no no don't don't do what he's doing oh there's a bin lorry in front i think now should we change gears or can we move in a second it's downhill so we can take it okay that's fine yeah that's fine check and go now just be careful just definitely signal right yep and then slowly keep going [Music] yeah when you get a chance and turn that off when you get a chance and keep to the left fully again so you feel that jolt that was the clutch coming up a bit too fast yeah yes all right so we're gonna make a left yeah left at the end [Music] and then off you go keep the keep the steering turned yep there you go move a bit more a bit more,224.4,291.919,840,196,oCdP6rjD8UM,1548,https://youtu.be/oCdP6rjD8UM?t=224,
speed that's it and as soon as you're here checking behind brilliant [Music] and then slowly up to three like that okay so this roundabout we're gonna go straight on and left you'll have to look at the sign can you see the sign yeah it's a right click position on the right so check the mirror and position no signal no signal good just breaking a little bit for the learner car in front and then we're gonna see where do we stop here yes good and then get ready straight away so we need them to go before we move forward all right so let's move forward now all the way go into that corner a little bit and have a look can we go before can we go after this gray one make sure that lori's not coming yeah should we go yeah yeah let's go good and then check the left mirror but don't turn too much you see what that silver card did he went from the wrong lane now signal signal signal signal when you exit okay all right good,294.16,366.8,923,200,oCdP6rjD8UM,1548,https://youtu.be/oCdP6rjD8UM?t=294,
so as you enter that roundabout you check the mirror and after uh first exit signal yeah okay just watch that left a bit more someone's driving really stupid there just keep more left how regular oh how reckless couldn't even speak there that was really dangerous yes all right just watch your speed there a little bit because we are going over by a lot now so be careful with the downhill so 1918 is okay even if you go a little bit over one two and then it comes back down that's okay because it is a big road but don't keep doing it yeah yeah hold on break yeah then clutch yeah and then again okay so when you're moving off accelerate a little bit on the biting point now so let's try it now so accelerate a little bit yeah this is boating yeah and then accelerate a little bit and stay behind the bus fully we're gonna go straight on good come over this way a bit more you're over the line look what happened there how did that happen,368.319,443.12,939,197,oCdP6rjD8UM,1548,https://youtu.be/oCdP6rjD8UM?t=368,
so that's the clutch dude for the hospital yeah just watch your speed there again you're going over again you gotta keep it controlled there you go that's better so we're gonna go work on some roundabouts first and i know the other concern that you have is your uh [Music] yeah it definitely makes a difference watching yourself yeah because then you can see oh wait yeah after if i didn't record it yeah i don't know where i did wrong yeah main some point i could no but major i i forget this way you can't forget me yes this time that's why i okay so what we're going to try first on this roundabout is we're going to go straight ahead we're going to try the same route you had in the mock so rice lip your dry skin now rice lip is 12. this 12 it should be liftly but on this one there's floor marking and you have to be on the right because it says rice lip with a straight arrow,445.44,516.08,882,197,oCdP6rjD8UM,1548,https://youtu.be/oCdP6rjD8UM?t=445,
because of the road markings okay now can you see the space is quite small so what do we do stop break and break and break and clutch now you see the space is quite small so what do we do stop break and break ants break and clutch yeah slowly go in don't rush slowly go in come on lift and hold don't rush don't rush that brush so that space there we can't go through it or normally because that was too narrow yes yeah that's what we were talking about earlier now speed up a bit more a bit more speed it's traffic light controlled yet go into the roundabout like this now check this left mirror check the mirror yeah and that's your lane there so this is what we're talking about yeah it's a break and yeah make sure you keep it straight it's all it's sick oh first yeah yes so do you get why we stalled there oh because uh i thought i'll i will not stop i'll go my face will start tight,517.839,573.92,889,195,oCdP6rjD8UM,1548,https://youtu.be/oCdP6rjD8UM?t=517,
that's why i forget to push the clutch we definitely have to book clutch here okay uh we go for this we're gonna we're gonna stay in this lane no matter what happens you have to stay in this lane okay because i know in the mock you were changing so let's go now yeah let's go good accelerate a little bit more yeah we're going to stay in this lane we're not changing the whole pedal break and then clutch like that okay and the after that i'll give the signal on left we can signal now okay yeah do it now and then feet ready let's go this thing didn't stop here yeah last watch the blue car he's wrong to do that but there we are carry on stay in this lane no matter what happens i don't want you changing because we don't need to do it oh okay yeah last time i changed yeah and that's why you missed the traffic light just check this mirror as you're coming off yeah and slowly go forward i want you to bring the clutch up slower,576.56,634.0,931,204,oCdP6rjD8UM,1548,https://youtu.be/oCdP6rjD8UM?t=576,
slower because there's a bit of a jolt with the gears especially in second oh okay yeah like this yeah that's better go a little bit quicker now because it's 40. yeah go for it but remember at higher speeds the steering wheel is more sensitive yes so we don't want to do any any any big movements now keep it steady okay so we're going to go right so signal now start breaking yeah bring that number down to like 20. good a bit more down good now change gear early so we're not doing it at the roundabout second gear good now keep going forward have a look that's fine and then what do we do with this what else do we do now that you've stopped one more thing first gear oh that's it feet ready no the right car after that don't rush don't rush yeah in you go go quickly when you go was your 40 mile but don't worry about 40 on the roundabout okay,636.399,701.76,847,193,oCdP6rjD8UM,1548,https://youtu.be/oCdP6rjD8UM?t=636,
so this is the first exit this is second we want to leave on the third this is the second yeah good now check the mirror and move but don't signal and then signal together and go quickly don't break that okay and there's your exit now you see here there's two lanes yeah but now there is this is for one lane one lane yes last time i didn't off now now we're gonna go quickly into fourth gear because you're fast enough and it's downhill that's fine don't worry and then speed up a bit more because it is 50. we need to go a bit faster because the cars will be 50 up there okay and then go to the next gear yes clutch up a little bit and go a bit quicker if you can a bit quicker how do we join the slip road what do we do uh take the signal and lean forward to check good like this when you're checking the mirror just turn that off now and stay in this lane so we're not moving lanes now,703.839,762.0,889,201,oCdP6rjD8UM,1548,https://youtu.be/oCdP6rjD8UM?t=703,
good you can come a little bit to the left that's it and just maintain that you doing okay yes how was the last round about yeah it's good yeah that's clear make sure when it comes to roundabouts that you're um giving yourself more time by being a bit slower and then changing gears so you don't want to get to the roundabout too quickly okay so on this next roundabout we're going to turn right third exit right again it's on our right yeah so it's a little bit too early to signal but you can see traffic so i want you to deal with this on your own now uh yeah okay yeah he threw yeah third exit heathrow good pop break and clutch good [Music] that's fine so now the signal yeah when the line is mixed up they will get confused how do you mean two three when there's three okay but normally it starts from two yeah so you're starting on the left if you're going left or straight yeah and you,771.12,849.279,893,197,oCdP6rjD8UM,1548,https://youtu.be/oCdP6rjD8UM?t=771,
start on the right if your exit is after twice after that all the road markings are telling you a certain way and then from there but when you are going so fast because about like uh without signal yeah it's a giveaway roundabout but you still wouldn't go that fast yeah you have to go at a speed you can control and you can see everything okay yes all right so as we enter you can see the right arrow yeah go fully into that lane and then start counting the exits and go at a speed you can control that's one good now there's two check the mirror check check this mirror but don't move can you see the van yeah now signal this way oh okay so we got into the wrong lane now because you stayed too much this way signal left but no no don't move don't move you've got to you've got to tell them you want to move over yeah you have to start signaling first keep going is it clear yeah then fully move over,850.88,906.639,902,193,oCdP6rjD8UM,1548,https://youtu.be/oCdP6rjD8UM?t=850,
so when you're checking your mirrors signal but don't move okay because then at least they know that you want to move over okay i took wrong length yeah because i need to come and middle it yes okay that's it you keep going right yeah yes okay that's the problem just listen to the car what do we need yeah okay three now from the bus lane check your mirrors and signal right because the bus is going onto the bus stop first just keep going as normal yeah and think about what we're doing here yeah that's it so this time on the roundabout we're going to go to heathrow you throw again yeah the second exit will keep the car in left lane yeah all right feet ready yes we're going to go no second exit so no signals a little bit quicker to go in just be careful of that white car but you're following behind the black cab that's not your fault that's not your fault he's in the wrong though yeah okay be careful of that white car but you're,908.88,993.519,939,202,oCdP6rjD8UM,1548,https://youtu.be/oCdP6rjD8UM?t=908,
following behind the black cab that's not your fault that's not your fault he's in the wrong though yeah okay carry on that's not your fault at all that's your lane yes you have to be careful of other drivers they do that all the time yeah i can't believe that guy still they have lessons i know see people like this good and we're going to get to the speed of the road again nice and quickly into fourth gear and driving nicely in this lane okay now simon in a little while we are turning right third exit which means we are going to switch lanes okay i need you to go a little bit quicker for now and stay in this lane stay here now check top and right signal but stay in this lane but don't go fast don't go fast watch your speed watch your speed mirrors again top and right now move over slowly with the steering very light steering you see the steering was quite quick still turn that off and keep going for now,995.12,1068.0,916,192,oCdP6rjD8UM,1548,https://youtu.be/oCdP6rjD8UM?t=995,
so i'm going to talk you through this one it's a signal right try not to move too much we're at a fast speed it's a third exit third exit yeah you need yeah so think about what you want to do for the roundabout now slow yeah good and now that we're slow change gear about here always change gear early second gear have a look okay get ready again so first gear now try and change gear a little bit earlier next time okay okay so feet ready move your right foot on the gas pedal when you're getting ready what about after the blue one yes yeah okay we've got to go quickly and that's your lane there good and then change gear and count the exits with me so that's one one yeah there's two so what do we do at two if we're leaving at three so we move yeah come on move move move good and then signal and keep going don't break there you've got to keep it flowing okay that's right no they will wait for you,1070.24,1140.24,904,200,oCdP6rjD8UM,1548,https://youtu.be/oCdP6rjD8UM?t=1070,
go a little bit slower drive at a speed you can control don't go too fast okay just because it says that it doesn't mean you have to do 30 though okay it's a breaking clutch yeah yeah oh thank god this time was very nice all right nice and easy no brush that's it good listen to it thank you good change here a bit earlier next time okay [Music] oh what is he doing how silly even he knows some people are you ready first gear and there you go [Music] oh what is he doing silly but you're right people like this have a license hey yeah they are blessed at least now i'm much confident about clutch yeah that's been a lot better we've only had one stall good just turn it really quickly that's it good now you can see the new speed of the road that we're joining 50 okay it's really important that we're trying to get to that number okay okay this is slip road yeah where do i need to,1142.0,1235.36,883,197,oCdP6rjD8UM,1548,https://youtu.be/oCdP6rjD8UM?t=1142,
come forward yeah go to third gear but we have to do that at the end okay not here so speed up now so we don't want to lean forward just yet good and then change gear again good keep this position start signaling clutch up and just lean forward and check is it okay yeah and just nicely joining that first lane that's it with the steering can you see it's a bit sudden good turn that off come a little bit to the left if you can with your steering try not to move too much because it's really sensitive right now come a little bit to the left that's it hold it hold it now we're going to move into the right lane so check your mirrors is it safe yeah now with your steering side i want you to really gently turn tiny bit to move lanes that's it no more than that no more see that is that better yeah keep your signal running and then for the roundabout we're going to slow down so bring it down to 20 miles per hour,1237.28,1297.6,915,198,oCdP6rjD8UM,1548,https://youtu.be/oCdP6rjD8UM?t=1237,
aim for that number and now go to second gear early about here second game to me yeah now go slowly have a look can we go yes yeah let's go now you see how that was so much easier yeah it's so perfect third exit yeah so this is number one what yeah that's number two so we move out check an amp without check signal check signal signal you need to start signaling at that point as well okay this is the signal left at that point go slowly go slowly okay now put it in reverse gear good then look around first good okay moving slowly just look at that reference and we need it in the middle of the window so where is it now is it on now the knock on your shoulder right yeah okay so go slowly back and let it get to the middle and then turn fully to the right while you're moving is it there turn fully right right yes fully look all around and keep moving good keep moving and just keep looking around good now look this way and look behind me,1299.36,1384.24,943,198,oCdP6rjD8UM,1548,https://youtu.be/oCdP6rjD8UM?t=1299,
and look in the mirror next to you and that line looks parallel only then we're going to straighten up yeah now straight no it's not not yet not yet about now it's straight isn't it turn back now one and a half one yeah make it straight that's it now look around and just reverse straight yes now it's much easier but look look behind you now so don't look at the look of like the back window this way that's it so you don't want to look at any one point for too long so keep going back keep looking yeah keep looking and keep moving now go quickly back that's it keep going all the way and then stop when the line is underneath your mirror see the white line yeah yeah stop there now secure the car yeah push the handbrake and the start button push the handbrake first we haven't put the handbrake on yet so okay there you go now you can check yeah it's good are you happy with this maneuver yeah did it make sense because,1384.96,1446.24,923,203,oCdP6rjD8UM,1548,https://youtu.be/oCdP6rjD8UM?t=1384,
at the solid line i i need to make the reference point yeah so fully right there yeah when the cards are straight in the white solid line yeah we need to half turn one another yeah and then go forward so you can see it in the mirror quite well okay all right so going forward from today's lesson we're going to leave it there but i am going to go over some of this stuff with you but the main issues right now is when you're going right on roundabouts you're signaling and you're positioning but when you have to move left you're checking but you're not signaling okay and this happened a few times where i'm telling you put your signal on so we're going to go and work on this now okay and the other thing is a bit of your steering when changing lanes did you realize it was quite yeah yeah yeah how did you feel about the roundabouts approaching them and slowing down but now it's working on the lane yeah yeah so i think the approach to the,1448.559,1501.2,943,198,oCdP6rjD8UM,1548,https://youtu.be/oCdP6rjD8UM?t=1448,
roundabouts is definitely better um but yeah when you're looking in your mirrors if you see someone's next to you don't move in front of them okay okay because that happened like i think once or twice yeah because then you slow them down don't you oh so don't move lanes if someone is a little bit more much work on roundabouts it's definitely better than before the controls are a lot nicer but now it's more about safety safety with what's going on around you okay okay yes all right so we're going to continue to work on this but that's the end of our video today hopefully some of this um some of these tips have been useful for you guys as well and we're going to see how simon progresses and hopefully goes for her test but yeah she's definitely adamant on getting a manual car that's for sure thank you for watching and bye for now [Music],1502.4,1547.41,846,179,oCdP6rjD8UM,1548,https://youtu.be/oCdP6rjD8UM?t=1502,

all right so at the end here we're turning left and at the roundabout turn right third exit okay so left and then right okay oh can i tell you something so when i took my lesson wait what did you say left and right here at the roundabout time right there exit so you know when i did my actual test my instructor wrote left and right on my thumbs because i used to forget oh god when waiting to enter a roundabout be mindful if your signal has switched off you need to reapply as we got to the top of the roundabout bane straightened up her steering wheel which caused the indicator to click off i'm gonna wait as long as i can do people say that this is the worst roundabout by far yeah okay i think i can do it i can do it i can do it okay all right okay when you get grasp of it it's fine you're not going to take me for the gear roads are you do i stay in third,204.64,268.72,864,194,ZLwxjyfUPzI,2165,https://youtu.be/ZLwxjyfUPzI?t=204,
i think they said 35 you go into fourth and then at what point you go into 50 what is the uh speed limit i don't know let's see you'll have to look at the road okay so you do have a sixth gear never i think let's keep it low i don't know what the speed limit is my hands are sweating oh gosh all right at the roundabout i'd like you to take the fourth exit right okay the full things are right okay,272.0,305.039,398,96,ZLwxjyfUPzI,2165,https://youtu.be/ZLwxjyfUPzI?t=272,
no so it must have been a 40 or 50 road because now the 30 signs come up and oh reminder you you're not gonna tell me anything about driving because you can go from a fourth to a one right yeah advice for anyone don't learn automatic and then try learning manual because it's not good it's much harder isn't it yeah a lot harder but you've got a few years of experience driving a manual first i mean yeah i mean i drove it from like 2008 to all the way till like 1918 19 yeah i mean i drove an automatic in between and um it wasn't too bad because my actual car was an automatic so i mean at manual so it was fine the only thing was i passed on the manual and then drove my mom's automatic for like three months and then bought my first car so any shopping center a multi-story car park that had to go up i avoided it for the first year because i used to cause clutch control,323.12,388.96,875,197,ZLwxjyfUPzI,2165,https://youtu.be/ZLwxjyfUPzI?t=323,
so don't take me on a hill i'm telling you don't take me on the hill i shouldn't have said that yeah you shouldn't because i'm the worst it was horrible okay i i do miss driving a manual though okay so then there's one thing that you mustn't do or generally people just say that for cars where when is it in neutral and you're just plodding along my close thing coasting is that a good thing or a bad thing at low speeds it's okay at higher speeds it's bad oh yeah why do they say don't coast because you gain momentum you lose control of the car ah okay yeah so that's one thing i do do i've not done at least this isn't the other cars was it the older cars that have the reverse gear next to one [Music] they're the worst these roundabouts aren't bad with their traffic lights because then you know you can go right one two three four i think i'm in the right lane,391.12,454.72,866,199,ZLwxjyfUPzI,2165,https://youtu.be/ZLwxjyfUPzI?t=391,
i think this is what would be in my own car let's go down to second gear hello don't come into my lane behind a lesson driver you although i want to listen i should have got into that one he's indicating to go that way we should have been in that lane i think you're actually not going to tell me anything no no i'm right wait wait wait wait wait okay we got it we got it we've got it yeah i'm right because he's turning that thing he's a learner driver so if he's doing it right he must be right he must have an instructor telling him go this way unless he's on a test or a mock test okay i haven't driven in this area for such a long time okay we're 20 and if she's putting me on the thing oh it's telling me to change gear i haven't changed it right oh it's telling me to now go up but i should only be at 20. just stay in this,456.88,513.519,830,197,ZLwxjyfUPzI,2165,https://youtu.be/ZLwxjyfUPzI?t=456,

it's oh okay because i was just scared i would end up putting reverse gear in okay now i need to go into first i'll just let these guys go i'll take your time i guess i'll wait for him they say they need to be off the entire thing okay i'll go now i think first gear has to be the one everyone hates right have i got to go in first again okay [Music] should i go down okay that is second right not reverse if it goes into reverse it's going to make that he's in it okay i can't believe i've never driven your car oh out of curiosity if i go fast and it flashes do you get a ticket what flashes if i went too fast yeah if there's a camera so who pays for the chicken well they're going to send me a letter through the post which will say this is the you know what's happened uh who was driving yeah and then i'm gonna say well she was,609.12,691.6,833,192,ZLwxjyfUPzI,2165,https://youtu.be/ZLwxjyfUPzI?t=609,
driving so you ticketed it to me yeah is that what you do with the people well if it happens then yeah that would be the case because they want to know who was driving yeah i mean usually i drive my own car so i know anyways but yeah so they're going to ask who was driving and i know i wasn't driving at this time on this day so you really expect your guys nowhere you're still cruising through to stay at like 18 19. it is the speed limit right yeah okay so like with anyone that's got a provisional license if you get points you get a speeding fine they can't do the driving anymore they'd still get points yeah you'd still get um you can still get points on a provisional license okay take the next road on your left and you're happy with all these people well obviously because it is a speed limit with people behind you they must hate okay and then we go again 20. okay veins has a bad habit of resting her,693.2,758.079,912,198,ZLwxjyfUPzI,2165,https://youtu.be/ZLwxjyfUPzI?t=693,
left foot over on the clutch pedal this causes her to put the clutch down first any time she needs to slow down this also causes the clutch plates to burn up over time so always rest your left foot on the left hand side of the clutch there we go come to a standstill then in first gear oh this has a speed limit on that okay perfect that's amazing but it's not always to be trusted it may be wrong because on some of the roads where they change the speed limit this has been updated yeah we've gotta get you an updated version because i'm not gonna lie now i'm telling you for someone who drives obviously you're an instructor so you know the speed limit these speed limits aren't everywhere i'm telling you okay thank you [Music] slow down slow down thank you [Music] slow down slow down tell me if you get excited driving your car thing is with an automatic you just put your foot down and it goes with an autobahn everywhere the manual i,759.92,837.6,940,196,ZLwxjyfUPzI,2165,https://youtu.be/ZLwxjyfUPzI?t=759,

win a little bit out would you like to park fully that'll be fine thank you okay what i'd like you to do now is to reverse back for about two car lengths keeping a reasonable distance from the pavement okay and try not to touch the curb as you're doing this okay two car lengths yeah from this tree you can measure two columns okay coolio just just keep it straight isn't it you want to slowly okay i think because i was pretty out before i think i'm perfect now and there we go thank you travel when you're ready talking about taking people off like the track and like making them but i mean i'm okay right but imagine other people she's telling me to pull over what am i gonna do oh my god am i gonna park my car now and then you tell them to drive off again it's getting it's getting worse and worse no one will pass at this rate what is it there's probably no this is the practical the theories,1418.559,1479.279,898,192,ZLwxjyfUPzI,2165,https://youtu.be/ZLwxjyfUPzI?t=1418,
how many questions do you need to pass with that one what was it 23 out of 50 it's the same our time like it's ancient well practically the way you said it 13 years i thought i was still young literally do you know what i'm really liking driving this wait there please thank you and i will say thank you to you yeah i actually want an autumn a manual now i think i like it it's quite nice to drive isn't it left at the end cruise a little bit slow down hey hey hey well thank you if i didn't know how to drive i would have been squashed left you said right yeah look at these guys yeah he did turn in very badly but yeah i mean is it okay to take both hands of the steering to sort your hair out oh are you telling me i can do that oh no no no no no it's not okay okay slow me down see i was always right you said yes right all right we're just going to take our,1481.2,1562.48,862,199,ZLwxjyfUPzI,2165,https://youtu.be/ZLwxjyfUPzI?t=1481,
sweet old time look at both sides definition of like when i'm gonna become a granny how i'm gonna drive is literally now like how i'm driving now i'm telling you i'm gonna be one of those so you think you're driving slow no no no i'm driving absolutely fine i just mean i'm like just i mean i'm always cautious when you're driving automatically you're pretty much driving one hand anyways i know guide your eye driver too just generally saying follow the road ahead of the roundabout okay [Music] take my sweet little time she hasn't taken a pen out so that's good okay so that one has an arrow to go that side and this one has an arrow to go there i'm just gonna stop at the zebra crossing i can go i can go do i need to indicate i mean when we're going forward we don't we didn't you did that really well slow down just hover over gently to one lane we don't want a lane hog,1563.6,1644.32,876,196,ZLwxjyfUPzI,2165,https://youtu.be/ZLwxjyfUPzI?t=1563,
and break and now you can go down gears right you can break in a third right it doesn't matter which gear you're in oh got a bit hot in here for a second because if you're a learner car you should stay in the left lane because the right no if you're normal driving you should stay in the left lane yeah deliver the right lane is if you want to go like just if you want to overtake okay no but if there now there's that there was two lanes there yeah yeah but generally he's like speaking yeah you would like now they're splitting into two lanes and learn a card meant to stay in the left no i can go on the right if i wanted to overtake it's atlanta so if the learner wants to go over to if the learner wants to overtake they can move to the right i thought learners can't overtake why can't they because they're learning unless you're teaching them to overtake yeah of course you're really struggling with the,1648.72,1706.64,910,199,ZLwxjyfUPzI,2165,https://youtu.be/ZLwxjyfUPzI?t=1648,
sleeping aren't you do you know what it is i don't know what it is because there's no cameras here right so usually you would be at like 24 hands on the wheel 24 or something well on a 20 go and slow it down don't do that don't do that we get pulled over it's your license on the line not mine yes just do you know what i'm never going to see those drivers behind me and i'm not even in my own car is that what's making you go faster because they're right up my ass look when i slow down it becomes a cue at the back because you're at the speed of the road so clearly none of them are yeah but they're not they're not slow down remember they're not on a driving test yeah do you know what the only thing is because i'm not gonna lie once you start driving you forget lanes like around depends on the wheel you forget roundabout lanes oh indicate you forget roundabout lane so i think,1707.52,1766.48,883,201,ZLwxjyfUPzI,2165,https://youtu.be/ZLwxjyfUPzI?t=1707,
that's the only thing because i maybe do lane jump i'm not gonna lie i do lame jump okay no wait third gear all your roundabouts have actually been fine oh have they oh i thought i was in the wrong lane okay this is a finally a 40 speed so let us go into fifth gear not really doing much of it but yeah still going to stay on 38 and if he wants to overtake he's going to keep one hand on the steering at least yeah right lane he's gonna go in there and he's gonna overtake i'll just stay here see you later mate you wanna lesson we're very far to the right aren't we in our name oh okay i was just scared if we don't go in the bushes i'm scared we're gonna cross over oh well slow down we're cruising the roundabout take the first exit okay first and here's this point i think that third there for a second okay about now is when we get slow,1768.48,1828.24,841,194,ZLwxjyfUPzI,2165,https://youtu.be/ZLwxjyfUPzI?t=1768,
because when you get the two lines on the road that's when you should start slowing down and we're gonna have to go into a lower gear okay you wanted to go okay you go i'll just casually take my time and where are we going here we're gonna go into starbucks now oh okay oh god i don't know why people like that again this is the difference between an automatic and a manual because with an automatic you just rev it and go yeah it's to reverse into a space on the left side if you can reverse into a space okay reverse yeah i think i'm pretty good at reversing parking so i don't think my mirrors are right there not click of a button all right follow that line round okay i don't know i think i'm straightening up the car right okay i think i'm pretty good oh maybe that'd be great though thank you shoes i don't push my car any more back than it needs to be and hit the button yes and switch off the engine,1831.679,1909.919,908,199,ZLwxjyfUPzI,2165,https://youtu.be/ZLwxjyfUPzI?t=1831,
and switch it off all right you can have a little break give me a few minutes how'd you think of my driving it's pretty good in it better than when i took you took me to kingston and i pulled over to that motorway i'm gonna go so scared okay so realistically if this was a driving test i would fortunately would have failed no wait for what there's a few things um when you moved off at the very beginning this roundabout where you had no right signal when you turned right and that's a straight fail yeah because you're going right and somebody in front doesn't realize you're going right here so that was the first step but on that one you you know you could have got away with a minor because nobody was in front at that time then the over speeding went over speed quite a few times okay yeah so if i was in a real test i probably wouldn't but oh okay so this one's gonna and then there was your,1911.12,1960.84,898,192,ZLwxjyfUPzI,2165,https://youtu.be/ZLwxjyfUPzI?t=1911,

[Music] just just stop there just stop there just drive off when you're ready okay it's not this turning it's that one there [Music] hi guys welcome back to clearview driving today i'm doing a mock test with anthony hey guys now this is the first time we're driving together yeah and you've done i think you said 16 hours yeah of driving lessons but you have been driving for a year in goa so you've got a lot of experience under your belt yeah but not necessarily here and your driving test is in about a week one week a week okay so we've got a mock test in the area where his driving test is so this will help you out with uh hopefully getting familiar with the roads a bit more all right so you kind of know what's involved in a mock test yeah okay so i want you to keep following the road ahead whenever i need you to turn i will tell you but i am going to use a sat nav,0.0,60.079,875,195,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=0,
for the first sort of 20 minutes or so and then give you normal instructions after okay i'm going to get you to do one maneuver and i might also get you to do the emergency stop similar to everything you've been practicing with your instructor okay okay so before we get started i'm going to ask you a quick question yeah so could you tell me how do you check that your brakes are working before starting a journey so turn on the ignition press on the brakes make sure that it's not spongy or slacks and then test the brakes when you're setting off and make sure that it doesn't go on one side okay that's fine all right so when you're ready okay we're gonna start one second i forgot one thing all right so for anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe to the channel if you haven't already and select that bell icon so that you get a notification every time that i'm uploading on youtube smash that,62.239,109.6,955,200,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=62,
like button yeah smash the like button all right so we're getting ready so whenever you're ready then anthony i'd like you to start the engine and we're gonna get driving and the sat nav should start so you can see at the very top where we're going okay there you go [Music] so we're making a left from here and then following this down okay [Music] approaching the roundabout ahead anthony makes a serious mistake with his control with the gears as he reaches the roundabout he goes into third gear accidentally which causes the engine to switch off as he tries to move off he quickly restarts and tries to move off again but doesn't change his gear anytime the engine switches off you should always make sure to check that it's definitely in first gear cross the roundabout and take the first exit,112.0,188.4,799,164,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=112,
[Music] anthony you're in third gear [Music] um [Music],204.59,230.62,55,17,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=204,
go left on the roundabout and take the first exit,265.919,268.16,49,11,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=265,
[Music],287.26,287.26,7,3,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=287,
you can pull over and park up on the left somewhere safe [Music] that's great thank you drive up when you're ready when waiting on the side of the road to move off always remember to check over your right blind spot as a final check at the very end before moving away as this area is not covered in your mirrors [Music] anthony shows really good awareness and planning as there are parked vehicles on the right hand side of the road he's keeping more towards the left which allows for oncoming traffic to easily pass through the middle he's got really good awareness in his mirrors as he's checking before moving towards the right hand side [Music] go right on the roundabout and take the second exit,311.44,390.56,700,143,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=311,
cross the roundabout and take the second exit [Music] so [Music] you could put it in park up on the left just before the blue car but leave about a car's length in front so get fairly close to the car [Music] just keep going forward a bit more that'll be great thank you and drive up when you're ready,413.28,460.4,301,70,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=413,
[Music] once in the road anthony makes really good progress to get up to the speed of the road really quickly after 200 yards go left on the roundabout and take the first exit v361 [Music] go left on the roundabout and take the first exit [Music] at this next roundabout we're following the road ahead second exit just before the roundabout there is a zebra crossing so always be mindful to scan on approach to the crossing and then look towards the roundabout as it's very easy to miss pedestrians if your attention goes on the roundabout too early [Music],481.17,550.05,557,121,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=481,
driving down a high street like this is a much higher chance of a hazard developing as somebody may swing the door open into the road or pedestrians may step out from behind a parked vehicle so keep scanning both sides as you're driving through this busy road as the high street is really narrow the traffic lights ahead tend to change really quickly from the point when a pedestrian first presses the button to the traffic lights going red so if you notice a pedestrian approaching the traffic lights be mindful to step off the accelerator as the lights may switch suddenly,575.2,608.88,574,105,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=575,
so [Music] on approach to the next right turn anthony does make a serious mistake with response to road markings as he tries to turn into a no entry on approach to any right turn always make sure that you're looking into the road where you're going as there will be clear no entry signs and no entry road markings he should have turned into the second half of the road turn right [Music] it's not this turning it's that one there it's not this turning it's that one there [Music],625.04,683.42,479,104,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=625,
if you can pull in and park up on the left just behind the black car but leave enough space in front again that's great there thank you all right so now i'd like you to carry out the parallel park exercise using the black car in front so i want you to start in the road next to the car and then reverse back and finish within two columns think of the driveway as a high curb don't worry if you're in front of the drive but don't go on the driveway okay um main criteria finish within two car lengths and don't touch the pavement okay whenever you're ready,699.76,736.48,555,118,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=699,
anthony should have straightened up the tires at this point this is about 45 degrees angle in the road when carrying out the parallel park exercise anthony gets a serious fault for his control with parking he wasn't able to park within the two car lengths as he's trying to park too close to the car and doesn't have enough space to fix the maneuver the back tire was climbing up onto the drive at this point so anthony tries to go forward to start again,780.56,807.6,454,94,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=780,
with his second attempt he tries to park even closer to the vehicle and i had to tell him to stop as we would have hit the car as we're reversing,842.48,847.92,145,32,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=842,
oh just just stop there just stop there just drive off when you're ready okay you're gonna hit the car go forward without turning straight in the wheel because you need to go past the back of the car okay now turn it left fully just drive on as normal okay when carrying out the parallel park anthony should have tried to turn the angle in the road slightly earlier so that he goes closer to the pavement without getting too close to the vehicle that he's parking with that will allow you more space and that you won't be worried about hitting the car you're parking with so the test criteria is to demonstrate parking within two car lengths so if the angle is slightly early that's not a concern as you have lots of space behind driving along this road with the double solid lines in the middle of the road means that you're not allowed to overtake on either side anthony maintains a really good position in the center of his lane and also keeps up to,865.76,930.24,952,190,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=865,
the speed of the road turn right [Music] turn right,932.72,948.0,51,12,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=932,
100 yards cross the roundabout and take the second exit then take the third left [Music] ahead of us is a prime example of why you should never park on the zigzag lines of a pedestrian crossing as we're approaching anthony couldn't see the left-hand side of the crossing and he should have been slowing down i had to break leading up to this crossing as he didn't notice the pedestrians on the left he gets a dangerous fault for this take the second exit then take the third left the third left yeah on approach to a zebra crossing if you can't see one side you should always slow down to make sure that it's definitely clear before continuing,982.72,1037.76,643,132,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=982,
[Music] after 80 yards go right on the roundabout and take the second exit b361 then turn left turn left then take the second right,1057.23,1091.36,131,30,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=1057,
after 80 yards turn right then cross the roundabout and take the second exit turn right then cross the roundabout and take the second exit [Music] cross the roundabout and take the second exit,1109.679,1137.84,192,40,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=1109,
left on the roundabout and take the first exit [Music] take the next road on your left please left lift,1160.24,1181.2,103,23,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=1160,
if you can just pull in and park on the left just behind that black car don't worry about the drives too much on this one it's great there thank you okay so what i'm going to get you to do now shortly we're going to so sorry shortly i'm going to get you to carry out the emergency stop okay okay so as you're driving down this road i'm going to make sure it's nice and safe no one's in front or behind and i'm gonna give you this signal stop as soon as you get that i need you to stop the car as quickly and as safely as possible oh sorry sorry so as soon as i give you that signal try and stop the car as quickly and as safely as possible as if a child had just come running out in front of you and you need to stop the vehicle okay but i will make sure it's nice and clear and wait for my signal before you stop the car okay thank you drive off whenever you're,1197.28,1243.6,862,195,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=1197,
ready,1244.72,1244.72,5,1,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=1244,
turn left from him [Music] okay so carry on driving is normal and wait for my signal [Music] stop thank you i won't be asking you to do that again drive off when you're ready and if you can just pull in and park on the right if not you know carry on dory don't worry about it just put it in park up on the left just before the white car don't worry about the driveways okay so just in that space right over there [Music] that'll be fine though thank you secure the car though i'm just gonna get you to reverse it back and let you know secure the car and you can switch off the engine as well what's that sound ah alrighty so just give me a few minutes how was the drive i'm bad a few um unexpected uh things in that wasn't there yeah four or five serious ones there's like very few miners but there's more serious lots so unfortunately it wouldn't be a pass on this occasion okay,1266.24,1389.44,879,198,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=1266,
um so let's start right from the beginning as you were driving we got to that first round about you stalled right yeah why did we stall i was in third gear yeah and i didn't say anything and it was just a minor at first you just thought okay whatever then you tried to move again in the same gear and i was like oh shoot don't do it don't do it you even restarted the car quite quickly you didn't you didn't need to press the button you just need to put the clutch down it would have restarted yeah and then you tried again and now everyone's frustrated it's like oh no and i thought come on change the gear and then you were trying again the third time and that's when i said no no it's not going to work and this is why so yeah you should have realized straight away that the pickup why is it not there yeah so i think maybe nerves yeah at the beginning yeah and i didn't try the car before,1391.44,1440.08,892,193,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=1391,
yeah no of course but yeah if there's an issue with the gear check it you kind of tried three three times and that's when i was but not happening um overall really good drive but the issues that have happened kind of like oh so like i said there really wasn't many miners that was just serious serious so the first one was gears of course and as we're going further um after the high street the high street was really good you're really dealing with everything anticipating well the satnav's telling you to go right and what was on your right hello no entry no entry and i thought oh he's not going to do it he's not going to do it and then you really tried and that's when i said not here over there i've always heard about that anointing so yeah even if you realized a bit late it would have been fine but you actually tried to turn in so that was really silly um then the parallel park what happened i don't know before coming to this uh,1441.12,1499.679,940,199,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=1441,
test yeah i did a maneuver like perfect i don't know what happened so with a parallel park you tried the first time and you're just trying to park too close with the car and the back tire did climb up on the first time so it was it wasn't really great you know that we were going that close but then you tried again you went right back into the road and then the second time you started even earlier where i was like shoot we're gonna hit this car and then you got so close where i had to just tell you to stop yeah yeah but did you realize how close you got okay so with that maneuver did you realize at the beginning i said park within two-car lengths yeah now what does that mean so i get um two car spaces basically yeah and you were trying to park within under one yeah i was just like why are we parking so close usually i do it but um i have that small little mirror over there yeah okay well we had the camera we had this,1501.6,1551.76,929,197,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=1501,
so there's a few other things i know it's different but um you were just trying to park in a really tight spot so what i would do is if this is kind of parallel how you started what you were doing was this and i'm just like why are we parking so close just do this just give yourself that space why do you need to you know and everyone was waiting yeah no that was okay you know whatever as we got into the road everyone turned up that wasn't even my concern because you were looking around and you know they got on with it but it was the pavement that's we're turning too sharply okay i think there was one more that's ever crossing so what happened on that zebra crossing was there was a vehicle that was parked on the pavement on the zigzag lines now nobody should park there right but the fact that the parked car is there yeah i didn't see it we can't see the left side so you should have come into that a bit,1553.84,1601.84,914,196,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=1553,
more cautiously now as you got there the lady kind of was distracted and i just had to quickly break there because the kid was right there so yeah um zebra crossings we need to be on high alert especially at the time of your test it's really busy then isn't it so you have to be really really careful when it comes to dealing with pedestrians ever crossings generally junctions just take it slower like really not much to say besides the serious mistakes okay yeah so is this how you uh expected today's mock test to go is this kind of what you expected from today's drive even if it's not the result you wanted yeah pretty much but um yeah i knew i would do some mistakes my main concern was mirror check yeah mirrors weren't that bad like there was one or two missing here and there but overall because you've been aware of your surroundings you know what's going on mirrors were never really an issue for me because we've got like one teeny mirror check missing one signal at,1603.12,1654.399,978,197,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=1603,
the beginning missing at the left turn but again nothing nothing substantial for me to actually say yeah this three majors four five yeah i think about five i haven't put the zebra crossing in yet okay all right so that's the end of our mock test video today so hopefully you can learn from some of anthony's mistakes and don't do what he was doing but um good luck with your test yes you know what you're doing you just need to brush up on these things and we will go cover over some of this stuff now so you know what's what but yeah thank you for watching don't forget to like comment and subscribe like and share do not like like and subscribe do not check yeah i'm joking do you know [Music] oh god bye-bye [Music],1656.08,1703.72,719,156,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=1656,
[Music] stop that [Music] just speed up a bit more and then come in okay [Music] hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving today i'm doing a mock test with josh now this is the first time we're driving together and you said your test is in about a month's time yeah and you've done around 40 hours probably from over the last year or so yeah since like beginning of december okay oh okay yeah not not too long then um so yeah your test has come coming up but your test is all the way in milton keynes which is completely kind of different from where we are today we're going to try and go on similar roads so that you can experience what the test would hopefully be like over there now do you know what kind of happens in the test how the mock test is going to go um i've just heard it last like it's 40 minutes you do one maneuver and,0.0,75.119,839,188,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=0,
you get taken down order yeah so you're gonna have a mixture of roads about 38 to 40 minutes of kind of start to finish but the drive's only really about half an hour okay all right so i'm going to get you to do one maneuver and it may also get you to carry out the emergency stop i'm going to give you 10 minutes of independent driving which is where i'm going to give you a series of directions to kind of follow um not following the sat nav in today's lesson okay all right so for anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below subscribe and select that bell icon so that you get a notification every time that i upload on youtube so you ready all right so throughout the drive following ahead okay all right josh whenever you're ready let's drive off please so,77.759,132.16,800,170,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=77,
[Music] at the end of the road turn right please josh has a really good approach to the junction he slows down using the foot brake and then puts the clutch down closer to the end of the road prepares in first gear straight away in the distance ahead you can see a vehicle crosses our road there's a gap on the left and right so always step off the accelerator in case somebody on the left or right hasn't noticed you're approaching you can pull in and park up on the left-hand side just before the silver car okay that's great though thank you so shortly i'm going to get you to carry out the parallel park exercise we're not going to use the silver car we'll use the one directly in front of them okay the little fiat 500 so i'd like you to go into the road next to the car and then reverse back and finish within two car lengths and try not to touch the pavement as you're doing this,158.4,247.2,886,189,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=158,
okay and don't worry if you're in front of the driveway when you're doing this as well all right when you're ready,248.959,252.64,114,26,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=248,
when moving off from this park position josh gets a minor fault for clearance from the silver car ahead with where he drives normally he's not used to having to use clutch control when moving out of narrow spaces as there's usually a lot of space,269.759,281.6,246,49,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=269,
josh does a really good job with his observation before starting to reverse and also whilst he's reversing he continues to look over his right blind spot and over towards his left to make sure that nobody is close to his vehicle while reversing he is using braking clutch together which does make it harder to control the speed of the vehicle when using clutch control lift the clutch up to move a little bit faster and dip the clutch down to slow the vehicle down the only time you need the foot brake is if you're on a gradient or if putting the clutch down doesn't slow you down enough so then you put the clutch down fully and then use the brake to control the speed josh does decide to go forward to readjust his maneuver this will give you a minor fault for control with your reverse parking he does look all around making sure that no one is on his right blind spot before going forward so remember to always check when you change directions so thank you driver for be ready,308.08,383.44,981,192,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=308,
and turn left just in here the entrance into the new road is really narrow josh turns in really slowly making sure not to swing out over the white line,397.759,408.639,151,31,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=397,
at the end of the road turn right please,424.0,424.0,40,9,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=424,
[Music] as we get to the end of this road the view of the new road is obscured by parked vehicles on both sides so you need to slowly edge forward when the road appears to be clear josh does this really well once we were out slightly the vehicle on the right decided to give way josh didn't realize until a little bit later,439.26,462.96,323,70,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=439,
the new road has a 20 miles per hour speed limit josh doesn't realize this and starts the speed up up to about 26 miles per hour i had to tell him to slow down as we're well over the speed limit it's a 20 zone a lot of the area is 20. there are various hazards and a lot more going on in the area we're driving in today than in the area that josh has previously driven so he's not used to dealing with as many hazards on the go when we get to the roundabout i'd like you to take the first exit left josh does get a serious fault for his awareness and planning to the zebra crossing ahead initially his attention is on the motorbike who is close to us josh does react slightly late to the pedestrian that's already on the crossing but the real hazard was the second pedestrian who's now hidden behind the red fan as we've tried to move forward,484.08,540.64,842,190,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=484,
always make sure to look both ways before you go forward especially when the windscreen pillars can easily hide pedestrians [Music] stop that,542.08,556.24,141,26,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=542,
[Music] so first okay [Music],573.56,586.47,29,9,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=573,
when we get to the next round about i want you to follow sign sticky throw piece he throws the first exit okay so first exit left if he's around okay it's an arrow for the,607.12,630.64,171,38,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=607,
so now carry on following signs to heathrow,645.76,647.279,43,10,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=645,
josh quickly gets up to the speed of the road maintaining a really good position in the center of his lane heathrow is the second exit on the next roundabout as we go forward the left hand lane splits into two and we can either use the far left or the middle lane josh goes into the middle lane which naturally puts him into the overtaking lane on the exit starting the roundabout from the middle lane isn't a major concern provided you stick to this lane once you get to the other side you make good progress and move back into the left-hand lane when safe it would be ideal to start in the left as you don't need to switch lanes after josh is being a little bit cautious at the roundabout but the gaps that he's missing they're not substantial enough to be a hesitation fault at the moment but as the traffic on the roundabout is moving really quickly when we enter we need to move in really quickly so that we don't slow anyone down,664.32,730.079,935,196,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=664,
josh does get a serious fault for junction observation the gap that he takes the vehicle on the right takes at the same time it was a safe gap but we moved in too slowly we did cause the vehicle approaching from the right to break harsh as we entered,732.959,744.88,250,51,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=732,
all right we're no longer following you through from here okay so we're gonna take the exit coming off here,779.2,783.92,107,22,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=779,
and then at the roundabout i'd like you to turn right third exit please,813.68,815.279,71,16,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=813,
as we're going forward the right hand lane splits into two halves we can use the middle or the far right to turn right josh goes into the far right lane which makes it harder to exit as it will naturally put us into the overtaking lane on the exit,831.12,842.959,247,53,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=831,
we're waiting at the correct point which should take us towards our exit currently second exit is directly in front of us so we should be trying to make our way towards the left to exit more easily josh continues in the lane that's closest to the roundabout which is now actually supposed to be for the fourth exit he needs to check his mirrors and signal left to make it clear that he wants to exit you can still switch lanes at this point provided that nobody is to your left and it's safe to switch over if it's not safe to switch lanes you can simply go back round the roundabout just don't move in front of other traffic josh gets a minor fault for signal necessary as he needed to signal to exit the roundabout once on the exit he continues trying to move in towards the far left lane it's not safe to always move towards a left straight away so try and make good progress in the overtaking lane and move back into the left when safe,860.8,932.399,939,194,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=860,
at the next set of traffic lights turn right there coming up shortly turn right josh deals with the lane change really safely by making sure that nobody is next to him before switching lanes he realizes he can no longer make the right turn and stays calm and continues to follow the road ahead going the wrong way will not give you a fault always stay calm if you know you're going the wrong way and the examiner will redirect you when it's safe to do so we're currently on a 40 miles per hour road so when the traffic lights change to green you need to get up to the speed of the road and then move back into the left-hand lane when it's safe josh starts moving into the left-hand lane straight away there's a bus in the far left lane who now has to slow down for us he is checking his mirrors but he's not reacting to what's actually happening he should have carried on in the right hand lane for a little bit longer,935.199,989.68,918,192,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=935,
[Music] just speed up a bit more and then come in okay [Music] just speed up a bit more and then come in okay okay just going a different way now okay well i'd like you to take the next road on your left so for a bus horn it was pretty quiet wasn't it didn't sound like the bus go left [Music],1005.17,1071.87,293,72,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=1005,
so we're just following the road ahead from here there's going to be two sets of traffic lights quite close together okay we're just going straight towards the heading from here so straight from both i suggest you use that middle lane here,1094.24,1104.96,239,46,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=1094,
so [Music] all right when it's safe to do so i'd like you to demonstrate how you would demiss the rear windscreen okay you can turn it off let the traffic lights turn right please [Music],1142.72,1192.35,187,44,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=1142,
if you can put it in park up on the left just ahead of this black car in that space [Music] okay drive open if you're ready don't worry it doesn't do anything do,1230.799,1267.679,161,39,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=1230,
[Music] at the roundabout follow the road ahead it's the second exit,1283.55,1291.2,68,16,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=1283,
[Music] so [Music] as we're waiting at this round about to enter the vehicles around us are taking risky gaps and entering the roundabout quickly but that doesn't mean that we should be taking the same gap as them when you find the right gap going to the roundabout really quickly making sure you go straight into your position and it's better to use a lower gear to do this so that you have quick acceleration as you enter so [Music] and then we're taking the sharp left just over here thank you [Music],1307.79,1390.78,504,108,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=1307,
joshua speed is this road this speed has to be fair though yeah so how do you know it's 30 [Music] approaching the traffic lights there are two lanes that turn right josh goes into the overtaking lane to turn right now starting in the overtaking lane and staying in the overtaking lane is not a serious fault as it's not for too long josh does start in the overtaking lane but as he's turning mid-turn he switches into the left-hand lane obstructing the path of a vehicle on the left giving him a serious fault for use of mirrors change direction again he's very used to moving back into the left-hand lane in the new road but as there's always traffic around us it's not safe to switch lanes like this he should have carried on in the overtaking lane and switch back later oh [Music] that's the roundabout let's turn like that exhibit [Music],1418.159,1510.17,843,185,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=1418,
take the next road on your left please [Music] and then take the next road on your right please,1549.679,1578.799,95,21,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=1549,
just behind that black car,1623.44,1623.44,26,5,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=1623,
okay just go forward and straighten up a bit more because we're going to leave the car here for a little while that'd be great thank you secure the car and switch off the engine okay that's the end of your driving test if you just give me a few minutes you okay to get back into that okay so that's the end of your test how was the drive for you well the lack of knowledge of the error got to me yeah um i know it could have been better but yeah so there are a few faults definitely um you've got good control of the car um but again you didn't know the area so some of the mistakes may have been happening because of that like the 20 zones yeah but um i want to talk about um the major concerns that we've got today so we've got use of mirrors change direction as a serious bolt and that came in twice um so the thing is you know when we were at that traffic light when you were,1641.039,1700.72,879,193,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=1641,
about to go the wrong way yeah yeah so going the wrong way is that okay yeah it's not far that's not a fault yeah so that's not a fault so you knew you were waiting and you couldn't go right so you turned off your signal you're waiting there quite calm as we moved forward what happened with that bus why did he use the horn i guess i was too close to him so as we moved off at the traffic lights what speed was that junction like the road it's a 40 road oh yes yeah so we're waiting on a 40 road and everyone's waiting and as you moved off you you're moving off but then as soon as you're moving off you're trying to move over and now you did signal you did check your mirrors but there's a bus really close and i don't think he was really looking to give you way um isn't it a little bit better for us to just get to that speed and then move over later yeah yeah yeah so you were,1702.24,1752.64,881,201,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=1702,
just kind of adamant on getting back to that normal driving position and that's kind of what made that serious fault occur so yeah we didn't need to rush back we could have moved back much later okay yeah yeah okay because the thing is it's only an issue if you're driving in the overtaking lane if you're slow so if you're there and you're kind of just staying there and you're you're kind of a hazard being there yeah everyone's gonna move yeah um and then the second time that issue happened was just back there now you know those traffic lights where we were turning right we're turning right and there are two lanes for turning right you happen to get into the overtaking one didn't you it was a straight and right lane right and uh so at the traffic lights we were going right there were two lanes going right you were in the second one was it two right only lint yes i think i only saw the first one yeah no,1754.96,1805.76,914,191,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=1754,
that's okay but then as we moved off there was a van on your left and he went round us and he went in the left lane as you're moving off you're checking your mirror and you're moving into the left lane and there was a prius black one you should have just stayed on the right so whatever lane you're in just turn in that one and just kind of make progress and then come back yeah so it wasn't an issue the fact that you're even in that lane it's the issue is you're changing and they're not expecting you to change at this point okay so you are checking your mirrors a lot of the times you are checking but you're you're kind of not acting on what you actually see yeah okay um then we had that pedestrian crossing quite early you know that zebra crossing yeah there were two pedestrians the first one caught you off by guard a little bit but then as you're waiting i think the windscreen pillar definitely was a blind spot wasn't it with that second man,1807.6,1854.64,953,204,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=1807,
yeah yeah because he was already in the road and i had to say stop even though you would have seen him you know had he stepped in a bit more but you would have moved by that point um so yeah when you're at zebra crossing yes and these pillars you can easily see behind them by just kind of yeah moving your head so that caught you off there um junction observation so this is that big roundabout where we were going straight and you managed to get into the middle lane and there was a bit of a queue in the middle lane but left and right were empty it was a 40 road again but we were following heathrow yeah and now as you kind of entered that round about the gap that you took with that silver bmw i think it was was was quite quite a risky gap he kind of he was stepping on it so the guy next to you you kind of both moved off together but the car next to you he,1855.76,1899.76,864,189,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=1855,
went a lot quicker than you did and it's one of those roads where if you can go in just you know be on your way go yeah was that the big that grey van truck kind of no this was so we did that round about twice so the first attempt we did that round about from the dual carriageway and we were going straight and you were in the middle lane yeah and you went straight from the middle lane so the path you took was great it's just the gap that you've taken to enter was risky so it wasn't it wasn't a good gap um the second time we did the roundabout we were on the the side road crossing the dual carriageway where it probably seemed like you were waiting for too long i had to feel like these are not safe i'm like how yeah exactly so the fact that you kept waiting it was fine because you didn't actually miss any opportunities there okay and i know it can sometimes feel like oh maybe i should be going yeah because everyone,1901.76,1950.88,926,202,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=1901,
else is trying yeah but the gaps they were taking weren't right you you saw yourself so you waited so that was fine but it's one of those roundabouts where when you go in you've got to go yeah i'm in you can't go in and go yeah i'm going in because it's just the traffic's just too fast so as you go in even if you wait for the right gap if you go in too slowly it's a bit risky yeah okay so you have to kind of really step on it when you go in um your parallel park is really nice okay just we had enough enough space at the back to continue you didn't actually need to go forward oh you were going in perfectly but it's okay that you went forward okay um just about your clutch control you have a tendency to kind of lift the clutch up but then use the brake to slow down instead of just squeezing the clutch down you get what i mean yeah it's like,1952.48,2000.88,850,191,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=1952,
the car feels like it doesn't want to sleep yeah i know it's done yeah yeah so we're gonna we're gonna work on that a little bit now and let me see if there's any others overall you know what you're doing you've got good control of your vehicle just make sure that you know what the speed limit is so anytime you get to a new road think okay wait are there any signs what is the speed limit and then drive up to that speed limit and if you're in the overtaking lane don't try and just move over get to the speed okay is it an issue if you carry on driving in the overtaking lane for a little while if you needed to well no it's not no right but when you're in the overtaking lane and it's 40 and now you're trying to do 20 and move over who's gonna want to slow down to 20 here to let you in so that's kind of what happened with the bus he was he was trying to get on with it and you're,2003.039,2048.32,886,209,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=2003,
like no let me move over first yeah all right that's basically the most of it really okay all right so that's the end of our mock test video today hopefully that video has been useful for you guys and you'll be able to watch this back and actually reflect on yeah actually this is what this is what happened but yeah thank you for watching and bye for now,2049.359,2070.639,355,73,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=2049,

okay hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving today i'm doing a mock test with asner now this is the first time we're driving together you've done around 40 hours yeah and you have done a test yes i have so you know what's involved in a mock test then um we're gonna go over a variety of roads just a mixture of roads and see how you do if there's any advice i can give you by the end and we'll go from there so we're gonna do one maneuver maybe the emergency stop similar to everything you've already been practicing um so your test was about you said a month ago yeah and you've got another test coming up yes tomorrow oh god tomorrow wait the test is tomorrow yes oh i didn't realize that i thought you were going away nope i see yeah she kept saying she wants a lesson before this date and i thought maybe she's going away no yeah that's fine okay well that makes more sense,25.359,76.72,883,192,yUKjw8Tr0Wk,1778,https://youtu.be/yUKjw8Tr0Wk?t=25,
that's probably why you're so nervous then yeah i get it i get it okay well we're gonna get straight into it then yeah so before we get started could you tell me oh yeah somebody could you tell me uh how would you know if there was an issue with your anti-lock braking system it would come up on the dashboard in abs okay perfect all right so that's now when you're ready let's start the engine oh god okay yeah oh yeah okay okay wait wait oh god can you tell it's my first time driving this car think about it i'm an idiot such an idiot sorry let's do a left turn [Music] oh my god asme has had a lot of driving experience outside of her driving lessons with her parents she's used to driving fully up to the speed of the road and always uses the highest gear possible this is great for fuel efficiency but always using the highest gear will make you go a little bit too fast sometimes sometimes it may,78.64,158.0,903,193,yUKjw8Tr0Wk,1778,https://youtu.be/yUKjw8Tr0Wk?t=78,
be better to use a lower gear for better control instead of using a higher gear for fuel efficiency as we're going forward there's a very clear 20 miles per hour gateway sign ahead which as may doesn't notice she continues driving 30 miles per hour through this zone giving her a serious fault for use of speed,160.16,182.0,310,63,yUKjw8Tr0Wk,1778,https://youtu.be/yUKjw8Tr0Wk?t=160,
i can't see it i'm literally trembling underneath this whoa a cool helmet that's a cool helmet oh oh okay yes sorry i thought change out the topic yeah sorry it was like it was a good topic changer i just didn't see it [Music] so,199.519,248.159,229,53,yUKjw8Tr0Wk,1778,https://youtu.be/yUKjw8Tr0Wk?t=199,

god i decided to embarrass myself today is really quick to get up to the speed of the road and uses the highest gear possible again but she does have a bit of a bad habit of resting her left foot on the clutch whilst driving this is not a good habit for a new driver as you're going to burn up the plates over time and this will wear down your clutch quicker so you always want to rest your left foot over on the left hand side of the clutch on the foot rest you know in north i think i don't know why i think it's north london anyways where i've come from humbly we never like i i hardly drove 20 take the next road on your right yeah hardly drove like 20 miles per hour for so long so you don't have the 20 limit there as much as much now leading up to this narrow road ahead asthmate is maintaining a good following distance from the vehicle ahead but as,351.12,431.599,857,188,yUKjw8Tr0Wk,1778,https://youtu.be/yUKjw8Tr0Wk?t=351,
we're going uphill to the brow of this hill she goes into third gear it's a better idea to be in second gear in case we need to control the speed as we're going downhill and plus because the road is fairly at the narrow lights turn right please as we're going forward asthmate ends up blocking the entrance of a road always make sure when stopping in traffic that there's enough space for you ahead if not you should stop before the junction if somebody turns up from the opposite side and they want to turn into this road this would end up causing congestion all the way up until the main road ahead never block entrances the right turn at the traffic light junction is an offside turning onto a dual carriageway there's normally space for two vehicles to wait in the middle of the junction as may does take a risky gap before the white van ahead [Music] when turning right always make sure that you're not going to affect the speed of the vehicle that's ahead of you they,433.759,514.08,973,199,yUKjw8Tr0Wk,1778,https://youtu.be/yUKjw8Tr0Wk?t=433,
shouldn't have to break for you or have to step off the accelerator before you make your turn at the roundabout turn left place is the first exit,515.839,525.2,145,31,yUKjw8Tr0Wk,1778,https://youtu.be/yUKjw8Tr0Wk?t=515,

okay ahead of us is the zebra crossing where there's an island dividing the two sides of the road making it two separate crossings somebody's about to start crossing from the right hand side of the road it was still safe for us to continue in this case,574.839,587.6,252,51,yUKjw8Tr0Wk,1778,https://youtu.be/yUKjw8Tr0Wk?t=574,
i apologize driving down this road asthma is in a really good position in the center of the road keeping a good clearance all round but as we get closer to the junction she starts moving back towards the left too early getting too close to the last part vehicle from the left [Music],612.0,631.71,283,56,yUKjw8Tr0Wk,1778,https://youtu.be/yUKjw8Tr0Wk?t=612,
you should always check your mirrors as soon as you turn into a neuro to see what's happening behind [Music] if you can pull it in park up on the left just pull before the grey car leave enough space to move away about yeah just in that space it doesn't need to be perfect don't worry this one that's great there thank you and drive off when you're ready,650.64,683.279,354,77,yUKjw8Tr0Wk,1778,https://youtu.be/yUKjw8Tr0Wk?t=650,

driving down this road asme nearly gets a serious fault for her control on the steering as we're passing some parked vehicles her attention goes on the indicator which clicks off as she tries to fix the indicator her steering was slightly off and i nearly had to intervene at this point let the traffic lights come right please [Music] as you're driving always try to prioritize whatever's the most important thing that's where your attention should be asme is a very confident driver when it comes to moving off and keeping up with the flow of the traffic always make sure that there's enough space for you before you go into the junction as we move into the middle the traffic lights are initially green and there's a lot of traffic in front and she waits in a good position as the traffic lights in front start changing to red some of the vehicles in front are now actually going through a red light you need to make sure we don't wait around in the middle of the,731.76,790.24,966,191,yUKjw8Tr0Wk,1778,https://youtu.be/yUKjw8Tr0Wk?t=731,
junction at this point as it puts you in a dangerous position she moves off fairly quickly [Music] while driving in slow moving traffic always make sure there's enough space for you ahead of junctions and crossings it's really important to keep these clear so that you're not obstructing the view of the crossing for traffic on the opposite side of the road and not blocking entrances always try and make sure that you've got tires and tarmac visible when you're stopping behind traffic this is in case anything happens if that vehicle was to roll back or you needed to move around this vehicle you've got enough space to do so right the roundabout term right third exit please turn right approaching this round about to turn right azme initially signals left as she enters the roundabout she manages to signal right in good time so this signal wasn't too confusing for drivers around her but always signal right when your exit is after 12 o'clock,791.44,866.56,947,184,yUKjw8Tr0Wk,1778,https://youtu.be/yUKjw8Tr0Wk?t=791,

my sense of direction is disgusting although we did turn into the overtaking lane on the dual carriageway this is not a major concern as long as you move back into the normal driving lane in good time you don't want to carry on driving in the overtaking lane for ages when you're not overtaking,900.72,926.079,294,63,yUKjw8Tr0Wk,1778,https://youtu.be/yUKjw8Tr0Wk?t=900,

at the second set of traffic lights turn left approaching traffic lights that have been green for a while always be prepared in case they change if you're slow enough and you have time you should stop turn left into the car whenever you're driving if you notice somebody's doing some sort of maneuver try not to go close to their vehicle try and maintain at least two car lengths of clearance in case they haven't noticed you're there and they might change direction suddenly all right if you can just stay in the middle of the road now i'd like you to reverse into a space on your left in one of these spaces here okay make sure you finish within the white lines by the end okay oh okay so the reverse here is take it up like this okay it's the first time i reverse in a car i've never reversed then let's do this oh where am i yep god my biggest knife,981.6,1108.88,853,177,yUKjw8Tr0Wk,1778,https://youtu.be/yUKjw8Tr0Wk?t=981,

once we're in the new road we're gonna make that left turn by the blue building okay the road we're moving on to is really wide with lots of traffic so when the right hand side of the road is clear we need to move halfway into the junction into the central reservation and get eye contact with the traffic on the main road in order to move in [Music] so remember we want to go in the second lane so look at that blue car's driver he'll give you away,1177.76,1205.52,449,98,yUKjw8Tr0Wk,1778,https://youtu.be/yUKjw8Tr0Wk?t=1177,

unfortunately it wouldn't be a pass and it's for something that happened really quite early on i know that i did not check before i pulled out for sure at first but what did happen so you're driving down that main road at the end we're driving on a nice big 30 road you're driving in third then you got into fourth as we're going forward there's very clear 20 signs on the sides and on the road you're flying through them at 30. and we got to the traffic lights and we're waiting and this is when the motorbike with you know the helmet guy yeah i yeah i know i know so that was a clear 20 zone we're going into at that crossroads and we were going fully at that you know i know you said you're not used to i'm not actually on my exam i like we have country roads that go to 50 60 more yeah so i don't know it was generally the first time we've driven a,1432.72,1482.4,852,199,yUKjw8Tr0Wk,1778,https://youtu.be/yUKjw8Tr0Wk?t=1432,
lot of 20. so i can see from your drive you you kind of really get on with it you're driving is very confident you're driving more like an experienced driver than uh like a a learner let's say which is really good which shows you've had a lot of experience and you've been you kind of drive with your dad you said a little bit so you really get on with it which is nice but when you're driving into busier sections you're kind of a bit too quick now leading up to that um so a few of the times you know when there's been a bit of traffic in front of us and there's a junction here or there's a zebra crossing you kind of get there and then you're like oh shoot yeah yeah so i i didn't realize a bit more awareness and planning with that definitely yeah um we had two clearance vaults pop up getting too close to the left car is really big i'm not it's not your,1484.48,1527.52,860,195,yUKjw8Tr0Wk,1778,https://youtu.be/yUKjw8Tr0Wk?t=1484,
fault but again yeah no it seems big it's actually not that big um so the first one was when we were you were driving down this road really nicely you had a good position in the middle but as we got to the end of the road there was a white line in the middle of the road and because you've seen the white line you're kind of moving towards the left when there's a car still there so we should have stayed in the middle for a bit longer okay okay um but again it's not a serious fault but it's just you you went closer than we needed to be and we we had no reason to actually come back in and the other serious fault um is actually your parallel your reverse park into the bay mostly for your observation yeah the guy that the clown out yeah yeah so the space you chose to park with him there's a gap between the hedges and he's playing like hide and seek or something i don't know what he was doing honestly then there was another guy with a dog,1530.32,1575.6,945,203,yUKjw8Tr0Wk,1778,https://youtu.be/yUKjw8Tr0Wk?t=1530,
yeah so unfortunately for you as you were looking right he popped up from the left and you're still moving and then you know you've seen him yeah but you really should have been looking around and even at the end afterwards when you kind of adjusted um you went forward and then when you came back you didn't look around you just started reversing back yeah yeah yeah i knew the reverse parking i i did not realize the speed one so that happened right at the beginning yeah okay i knew you didn't see those lines i didn't mention them anyways um and then we have that control with the gears where was this sorry come on i can't remember that one but okay there was another one you know where we were turning right at the traffic lights where there was a yellow box we went into the middle behind the car in front as you've gone in the middle there was a van approaching in front okay and he was he was coming straight and you've kind of turned in front of him and he was,1576.799,1629.44,970,198,yUKjw8Tr0Wk,1778,https://youtu.be/yUKjw8Tr0Wk?t=1576,
turning into the same road as us but it's your judgment on crossing their path we did slow him down a little bit uh okay yeah so i know which one yeah so if you're turning right and someone's coming through i thought i thought that i saw his um indicator and that's why i did it but then i kept thinking would this count as uh so it's definitely your fault because we're in his path right so like that's what i mean you're noticing all of this stuff and you're really good with the gears and stuff but because you're kind of driving it if you're going yep yep yep a to b driving that's why these pops these mistakes are kind of popping up because you're used to driving with your dad and he's probably telling you yep get on with it yeah yeah it's more about efficiency but it's good it's good but now you just need to be a bit more safer with your decisions okay yeah is it safe to turn,1631.12,1673.84,887,199,yUKjw8Tr0Wk,1778,https://youtu.be/yUKjw8Tr0Wk?t=1631,
before that van yeah yeah um you did well on the uh dual carriageway you know when you had to switch over lanes yeah yeah and you kind of ended up in the third lane and then you're like oh no you didn't panic and stuff which is really nice you checked your mirror signals you take your time moving towards the left which is really good um yeah so there's lots of good things but unfortunately these two here yeah yeah yeah you get those two so yeah it was the the speed one i kept every time i checked it was at 20 and i was like going like 21 and i was like oh god i ended up doing worse but fair enough you know what all right so that's the end of your uh overall not a lot going on so good luck with your test tomorrow as you know the roads around where your test is so this speed issue won't happen but just be mindful every time you're changing direction check yeah especially with your,1676.0,1722.88,891,192,yUKjw8Tr0Wk,1778,https://youtu.be/yUKjw8Tr0Wk?t=1676,
maneuvers if it's been a little while just check and see if someone's turned out what they're doing are they waiting should you wait yeah okay um there's probably a few bits in there i can't remember at the moment thank you um all right oh yeah the gear thing was at the beginning you know when you sat there in neutral trying to really god that's what that was that was embarrassment and then with the traffic light you're like oh i really have to do this to see it and i was like well yeah i know that was literally tested my intelligence though all right well that's the end of our mock test today hopefully that boxes will be useful for you guys as well don't forget to like the video comment down below and don't forget to follow me and all my socials which i always forget to say so there's tick tock there's instagram or clearview driving so be sure to follow guys bye bye good luck with your test [Music],1724.48,1776.97,912,195,yUKjw8Tr0Wk,1778,https://youtu.be/yUKjw8Tr0Wk?t=1724,
hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving today i'm doing a mop test with dear now dear's been learning to drive with me from a complete beginner we've done around 30 to 34 hours or so now this isn't her first mock test she knows what's involved in a mock test so we've done some before this kind of sometimes half an hour sometimes the whole thing yeah but today it's recorded now your test is coming up um how long it's first of july about it's not going to what it is but test is coming up in exactly a month's time yeah so you've got some time so hopefully if there's any mistakes we have we can cover them but hopefully we can get a nice pass today all right so before we get started you know what's involved in a test i'm not going to go through the details so i'm going to ask a quick question could you tell me where would you find the,26.96,75.28,847,189,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=26,
coolant and how do you check it's at the lower the right level it's in the bonnet so you have to open it from here okay and um it should be in between min and max but don't open it after you've been driving because it'd be steamy okay perfect that sounds good so when you're ready um we can start the engine and then we'll get driving so i'm gonna give you 15 10 15 minutes of independent driving as we're going okay okay,78.159,103.84,421,100,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=78,
[Music] on approach of this first round about to follow the road ahead the has got a good view of the roundabout so she looks quite early and she's able to continue without stopping,121.75,130.959,181,38,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=121,
[Music] at the roundabout turn left please on approach to the round about to turn left the air should have waited for the bus which was approaching from her right as they were turning into the same road we managed to get there just before the bus so this did not go down as a serious vault but you should always give way to the traffic on your right if the bus had been any faster this would have been a serious fault when passing any part vehicles always aim to leave at least one meter of clearance if you're not able to leave one meter then you need to travel slower thea does maintain a nice clearance all round but it's a good idea to always be checking your mirrors as you're moving your position in the road take the next road on your right [Music],156.69,215.19,755,156,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=156,
there maintains a nice position in the middle of the road as there are part vehicles on both sides when driving down roads like this always watch out for meeting situations and be prepared to give way on this occasion the van happened to give way but this should have approached a little bit slower [Music] if you can pull over and park up on the left please when the examiner gives you instructions to pull over and park try and look for a space to park up and try not to park up immediately dear pulls into the first space she sees and she ends up in front of someone's driveway she should have carried on a little bit further and then parked up in the next space available it's okay don't worry drive off when you're ready,232.319,278.639,725,145,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=232,
as we're going forward there's a bit of a situation ahead where there's been a collision there does keep to the left of the center line and she maintains a good distance from the vehicle ahead but she should have tried to position more towards the left so that vehicles oncoming have more space to go through the middle of the road small cars were able to continue through the small space but thea should have moved more towards the left when the larger van had approached,295.36,318.8,472,92,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=295,
there did move straight away but she should have definitely moved earlier because there was less space for the van to continue while waiting in this position to move off it's a good idea to signal right as we're having to completely come out of our lane to go around the obstruction ahead this way it makes it very clear to traffic in front and behind that we're having to move onto the right hand side of the road,363.68,382.96,414,82,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=363,

at the end of the road sound left please as we get to the end of this road to turn left there needs to look all around she's mainly looking towards the right as the road that we're moving on to is fairly narrow as we come out of this turn you will naturally swing out to avoid hitting the back tire as she moves out she gets a serious fault with her control and steering as she moves onto the opposite side of the road and moves in front of oncoming traffic,454.8,487.36,457,96,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=454,
[Music] approaching zebra crossings always step off the accelerator on approach and even break if you cannot see both sides clearly if your view is obscured by oncoming traffic always slow down as there may be a pedestrian easily hidden behind oncoming traffic,506.67,528.48,260,48,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=506,
on approach to any junctions if the examiner doesn't give you any instructions you need to keep following the road ahead if you're not sure where you're going you can always ask but always ask in advance so that you can position in good time,551.68,562.0,241,49,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=551,
as we're going forward there are part vehicles on the left hand side of the road there moves over to the middle in good time and then there's a large bus approaching she deals with the bus really nicely by slowing down in the middle of the road if it's necessary you can also come to a complete stop and then continue again when safe but she needs to check her mirrors more regularly as she's doing this movement when moving your position in the road always check your mirror's side to side as they could easily be a cyclist or a motorbike approaching now this isn't necessarily going to go down as a minor fault because nobody's actually around and when slowing down for turns thea is checking her mirror so this is not a fault but it's a good idea to be regularly checking your mirrors,581.279,625.04,787,158,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=581,
[Music] at the roundabout take the third exit right please on approach to this roundabout there is a zebra crossing before and after the roundabout she does deal with the junction well as she makes sure that it's safe to enter but as she goes into the roundabout she doesn't consider the zebra crossing that's just after and she does move in a bit too quickly there was a pedestrian approaching from the right as well as the scooter that was on the left-hand side pavement it wasn't safe for me to break at this point this did go down as a serious fault,642.73,680.399,553,117,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=642,
when it comes to dealing with pedestrians at zebra crossings seba crossings is where pedestrians have priority so always approach with caution and be prepared to give way even if you slow down and the pedestrian doesn't cross the road it's safer that way than you not slowing down and the pedestrians suddenly stepping into the road as we're driving forward i did ask thea to pull over and park on the left somewhere safe there are two marked spaces and she could have stopped in either of them if you miss the spaces completely and you don't realize it's safe to park there and you carried on driving this would not go down as a fault [Music] if you can pull over and park up on the left somewhere safe it's fine don't worry just keep driving,696.64,746.079,743,150,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=696,

if you can pull over and park up on the left piece just anywhere over here is fine all right what i'd like you to do now using the vehicle in front is to demonstrate how you'd carry out the parallel park exercise so start in the road next to the vehicle then reverse back and finish within two columns and treat the driveway as a high curve so don't go into that section okay okay,815.44,847.92,380,79,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=815,
so,865.92,865.92,2,1,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=865,
before starting to reverse at the very beginning dear does look all around but as we're reversing it's a good idea to check over towards the right as your vehicle swings in the road dia does park pretty well but she's slightly sticking out at this point so she decides to reverse and get closer to the pavement but she's not looked around at all since the very beginning so unfortunately this does go down as a serious fault as her car swings into the road again and she has not had any regular checks towards the right,892.88,919.36,519,102,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=892,
happy to leave with that yeah okay thank you travel when you're ready,952.88,954.959,69,14,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=952,
at the end time like this,980.639,980.639,25,6,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=980,
here,1048.96,1048.96,4,1,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=1048,
there slows down well to deal with the traffic lights ahead but as you're waiting at traffic lights always check your mirrors all round in case of anyone that may suddenly catch up and may try and overtake you normally this would be cyclists or motorbikes in this sort of traffic [Music] so always maintain a slow speed when you're driving down a high street as there's a much higher chance of a hazard developing down here than on the average road would park vehicles always keep scanning both sides in case anybody swings the door open or steps into the road suddenly following the road ahead from here the air does deal with the roundabout really well but just on the other side of the roundabout we've got a zebra crossing with two pedestrians approaching from the right we should have anticipated and had a slower approach in case they step into the road as soon as we went past the crossing they did start to cross so she did get a minor fault for this,1074.64,1151.12,958,189,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=1074,
always approach slowly when there are pedestrian crossings about as sometimes pedestrians don't look and they just step into the road,1153.36,1158.88,133,22,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=1153,

on approach to the next round about to follow the road ahead dear start scanning the junction to the right as we've got an open view with the park on the right she starts looking through the railings and she notices the van approaching and left [Music] if you can pull over and park up on the left anywhere safe thank you secured thank you that's the end of your driving test give me a few minutes okay yeah okay so that's the end of your drive how was the drive for you yeah it was okay would you say there were any serious faults yeah there were okay what was that um after the roundabout when the guy was at the crossing yeah there and i think there was like maybe two the way you approached yeah the on generally when it comes to zebra crossings you you weren't looking at pedestrians when they were a bit close or kind of even passing i just feel like we need to be a bit more cautious there yeah because on that particular,1243.679,1339.84,928,191,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=1243,
roundabout did you realize there was a zebra crossing before and this is ever crossing after yeah and that's because it's really popular for pedestrians to just want to cross at that intersection so we need to be really careful there yeah i didn't break on that one because you know he kind of took his time to go around but it's just the way he approached i was just like oh wow why are we going so quick and he's there yeah and then i think there was also somebody on the left who was on a skateboard i think i didn't see it too clearly because i was over there but we need to be really careful with zebra crossings okay um i've got two serious faults here one of them being your steering do you remember when you turned left out of that junction yeah what happened um we're turning left and you kind of stopped near the end of the road you're looking both ways it was a few cars on the right going quite quickly yeah after,1340.96,1385.36,925,194,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=1340,
those cars when it was clear yeah you come out and what happened as you come out there's a car there on the opposite side as soon as that happened i i knew it yeah so as well as looking right you should have thought about how we're turning and how it's going to affect the left side because you went over it was quite wide yeah yeah you didn't actually need to turn on on on that particular junction like that but if you feel like you're going to do that if you're going to swing out then we need to wait for the left to also be clear okay okay the other serious fault is yours reverse parking observation you're kind of going into that space it's a little bit funny you are slightly out yeah and then you decided to fix it again and now there's been a very long time since you've looked over towards the right yeah and then when you started steering left what's happening to the front of your car,1387.28,1433.36,897,188,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=1387,
swinging out and now is it safe for us to swing out when you've not checked no yeah so that's what gave you your serious fault for observation you did look initially but there was a very long time where we're just not checking yeah and your focus is all on this side and here you need to check over across okay yeah even before you even before that i was just thinking all the right sides not been checked enough so even as you're coming back check it halfway through okay okay yeah um two on position normal stop so as you're driving when i've asked you to park up um oh god he's fast forward so as i've asked you to park up with your two normal stops one of them on both of them the same thing happened actually there's some space to park up and you're kind of trying to pull into the first space and then you're trying to reverse and fix it yeah try and just kind of roll into this base in the distance if there's another one just go into that,1434.64,1482.48,946,202,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=1434,
one yeah see on the first one and we were too far and on the second one i think again we were just a bit too far out and you tried to go you tried to reverse to fix it but yeah tried to just go forward into a spot instead okay awareness and planning oh okay do you remember that car that had looked like i had an accident in front of us oh yeah now did you realize everybody was going past you very slowly are they going past me did you realize they were going a bit slower when they were near you oh yeah they're too far out yeah so when when we initially stopped you were a bit to the right and you know the first car managed but then that large lorry kind of climbed up and i thought come on move over he was pretty happy with the space but still come on just check the left move over and you did notice you did move yeah just try and have that position a bit earlier on okay and a signal just to get around the car yeah,1483.84,1530.08,923,197,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=1483,
i can't remember if you did actually oh and very early on there was a junction observation that first round about where we were turning left and there was that in you just stop front that bus then i thought it was too like far ahead but then i thought yeah i should stop we give priority to the right the bus is really approaching and you know he had to step off a little bit for us yeah it just didn't feel nice i was just thinking we'll be rushing to yeah yeah so overall zebra crossings you need to be a bit more careful with them yeah okay um junctions don't just look right you've got to consider how we're turning and if it's going to affect the left as well yeah because that's where one of the other serious faults come in and your parallel park making sure you're checking yeah if you haven't looked for a little while look again have a little break if you need to look around yeah yeah okay and you know the store what happened yeah so why did it stall,1531.76,1580.559,962,202,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=1531,
i was in second at first and then the second time it touches too fast yeah it's an uphill gradient right yeah so what do you need to do more accelerated more acceleration we weren't doing that definitely yeah yeah all right we've got plenty of time to fix this nothing to be worried about but not a lot going on yeah but just key areas where we can kind of brush up on a little bit more and try and check your mirrors a bit more regular like you check every time you're about to turn but when you're just driving in a straight line yeah there's a long period where you're just not looking looking yeah yeah just kind of look every so often in that top mirror every eight seconds or so okay okay all right well that's the end of our video today hopefully there's mock test has been useful for you guys as well don't forget to like comment and subscribe um i also forget to mention but follow me on tik tok on instagram,1582.08,1624.88,917,190,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=1582,

do you check it's at the right level so pop the hood you'll see the corner thing and there'll be a level on it so you should be able to tell because i think it's kind of see-through isn't it should be able to just tell from looking at it there if that if it's on the right okay yeah so you need to make sure it's between that min and max level yeah perfect all right okay whenever you're ready we'll get started for anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe if you haven't already and thank you for everyone for all your support alright we're gonna get started as we're going forward there's a van partially blocking the road and then the driver steps out into the road alex deals with this really well by slowing down and switching back into first gear you can see the driver is inviting us to pass make sure that there are no other hazards before you continue turn left please,67.119,136.0,933,195,fWjpJ1XIsGo,1706,https://youtu.be/fWjpJ1XIsGo?t=67,

as we turn into the new road alex notices the hazard straight away and checks his mirrors to move right as this enough space to move through the middle of the road we didn't need to signal in this case [Music],158.879,175.08,209,44,fWjpJ1XIsGo,1706,https://youtu.be/fWjpJ1XIsGo?t=158,
so [Music] he was turning left [Music] oh god i need to start dying now [Music] we're gonna go right at the traffic lights okay okay sorry as i keep closing as we went forward at the traffic lights the light started changing when we were quite close it was no longer safe to stop at this point [Music] the vehicle ahead is indicating to turn left the road is quite narrow so they had to slow down quite a bit alex deals with this really well by slowing down and switching back down to second gear and also maintains a good distance ahead [Music] as we're going forward this is now a 20 miles per hour zone there's a gateway sign on the left and right hand side of the road as we're going forward as well as the sign printed on the floor after this point there will be signs throughout to remind you that it's a 20 miles per hour zone at the round about 10 left is the first exit [Music],192.56,338.16,886,195,fWjpJ1XIsGo,1706,https://youtu.be/fWjpJ1XIsGo?t=192,

here's a prime example of why it's not safe to enter just because the traffic on the right is entering the silver car on the right enters the roundabout but we ended up waiting the gap was safe for them as they were simply crossing the path of the traffic on the roundabout whereas we're actually moving in front of that traffic so don't enter just because you see other people are entering the roundabout always make sure it's safe for you,355.52,376.8,440,90,fWjpJ1XIsGo,1706,https://youtu.be/fWjpJ1XIsGo?t=355,
both lanes go ahead on this roundabout but it's safer to stay in the left-hand lane to follow the road ahead as it's the position for normal driving and also if you start in the right-hand lane you may end up getting stuck behind traffic that's turning right in the roundabout which leads to more congestion [Music],417.68,436.52,315,66,fWjpJ1XIsGo,1706,https://youtu.be/fWjpJ1XIsGo?t=417,
okay i want you to take the next road on your left [Music] if you can pull in and park up on the left-hand side here you can just go up a bit further don't worry about the drives on this one okay just go up a bit further that's great all right what i'd like you to do now using the vehicle in front i'd like you to demonstrate how you would carry out the parallel park exercise so pull up alongside this vehicle in the road then reverse back and finish within two car lengths and try not to touch the pavement,466.639,518.0,509,111,fWjpJ1XIsGo,1706,https://youtu.be/fWjpJ1XIsGo?t=466,
alex starts off his maneuver really nicely by looking around and then turning left when we're parallel then turning right at about 45 degree angle after this point he doesn't look around towards his right when the back tire gets close to the pavement he turns right again now we are parked really nicely but the tires are still facing in the road he gets marked down for observation with this maneuver straightening up the tires does not get counted as a fault okay thank you drop in your weight,544.16,574.8,495,94,fWjpJ1XIsGo,1706,https://youtu.be/fWjpJ1XIsGo?t=544,

once we turn right into the new road alex thinks that he's straightened up the steering wheel but in fact the tyres are still facing towards the right as we moved off he did correct this straight away so this is not a fault [Music] leading up to the park vehicles ahead alex checks his mirrors towards the right to move into the middle of the road early that way he's able to leave a good clearance from the parked vehicles on the left-hand side always aim to be in the middle of the road at least two columns before the parked vehicle so that you're already passing them in the middle and not moving up to the vehicle up the mini roundabouts and right left knee right dead end,647.36,696.88,677,138,fWjpJ1XIsGo,1706,https://youtu.be/fWjpJ1XIsGo?t=647,

driving down a high street always keeps scanning both sides of the road especially when there are lots of parked vehicles as there is a higher chance of a hazard developing as we're going forward there is a pedestrian who suddenly runs into the road behind the bus,746.72,758.56,264,50,fWjpJ1XIsGo,1706,https://youtu.be/fWjpJ1XIsGo?t=746,
i had the roundabout turn right please [Music] as we're waiting at this roundabout to enter we need somebody on the main road to turn in towards our junction but you also need to watch the second car in case they're too close alex waits for a safe gap before entering,775.839,803.68,267,57,fWjpJ1XIsGo,1706,https://youtu.be/fWjpJ1XIsGo?t=775,

it's just 30 now i don't think we'll be getting 30. there's temporary roadworks ahead which are blocking the right hand side of the road there's also a sign which reads cycle lane closed alex ends up getting a clearance vault with the cones for the road works as he's trying to avoid using the cycle lane as it has a solid line but as the cycle lane is closed we should have driven over the solid lines [Music] it is a 30 miles per hour road but with the traffic on the right and the solid line with the narrow gap ahead it's not safe to drive up to that speed so always drive at a speed that's safe according to what's happening on the road as we go around this bend there's a lorry in the right hand lane who starts signaling to switch lanes quite suddenly alex deals with this really well by slowing down and switching into second gear it's quite hard to see the,858.32,933.519,865,188,fWjpJ1XIsGo,1706,https://youtu.be/fWjpJ1XIsGo?t=858,
indicator on the lorry as it's quite small especially when it's really sunny there is a giveaway line just as we pass the traffic lights but nobody should be on the right when we have green lights but it's a good idea to check regardless [Music],935.519,960.99,245,52,fWjpJ1XIsGo,1706,https://youtu.be/fWjpJ1XIsGo?t=935,
actually uh it's got an island the island in the middle of the road makes it two separate crossings so we didn't need to stop for the pedestrian on the right hand side take the next road on your right please on approach to this right turn alex gets a minor fault for hesitation we could have gone before the van that's ahead of us as we had enough time to turn the van was in fact waiting for us to turn as well as we got to the junction alex was initially assessing whether the pedestrians were going to cross the road comes,1008.839,1053.28,525,107,fWjpJ1XIsGo,1706,https://youtu.be/fWjpJ1XIsGo?t=1008,

[Music] when carrying out the emergency stop if somebody turns up in front or behind the examiner will wait until it's safe before they give you that signal they may even ask you to pull over and park again so that there's no one around if you can just pull into this space before the van here [Music] okay and then just uh move up again just load to be pretending,1283.26,1311.2,364,77,fWjpJ1XIsGo,1706,https://youtu.be/fWjpJ1XIsGo?t=1283,
might be your lucky day [Music] when carrying up the emergency stop always try to break firm and then put the clutch down so that you can stop the car quickly alex puts the brake and the clutch down together but he does break quite firm so we managed to stop really quickly even if you put the brake on and you forget about the clutch completely this would not give you a minor fault your car will stall but you will stop all right so we're still doing the emergency stuff okay okay stop all right thank you i'm not gonna get you to do that again try it off and you're ready stop all right thank you i'm not gonna get you to do that again drive off and you're ready [Music] always remember to check over your shoulders before moving off after an emergency stop if you don't look around and you move off you will get a serious fault for this and you will fail your driving test [Music] at the end of this [Music],1328.4,1410.73,911,193,fWjpJ1XIsGo,1706,https://youtu.be/fWjpJ1XIsGo?t=1328,

okay let's switch off the engine all right that's the end of the driving test awesome and so i think what's that noise all right so that's the end of your driving test how was the drive for you today i'm sorry just quite a few surprises popping out everywhere lots of hazards so lots and lots of them we had loads earlier as well um yeah that would be a pass that was a good that was a really good drive now we've done a few mock tests so you've had a few passes we've had a few sudden surprises in some of them but um no generally overall really nice drive i'm just going to go over the key points that we could have improved on so the first one you know the road marking on that keep clear you're kind of overhanging it yeah as soon as i started to go forward i think i think my coughing at that point probably added to the pressure of what was going on in the car,1437.44,1489.84,866,190,fWjpJ1XIsGo,1706,https://youtu.be/fWjpJ1XIsGo?t=1437,
okay um the other one that kind of stood out for me was your hesitation with that right turn yeah probably so what happened there um i think because you know the the light was changing so then that guy he was just staying there yeah um she was actually waiting for you so as we got there initially that traffic light was red and i know those pedestrians were there so you're watching them but none of them were actually interested in crossing lights still red i would have just turned in and then as the lights light in front started to flash you're expecting him to go yeah but he was waiting i think he even kind of invited us in a little bit and he carried on waiting so a bit of hesitation on that account um earlier whether you know where the roadworks were where you said oh it's a 30 but i don't think i'll be able to drive 30. so there was that roadworks just before we went in there was a sign on the left which said um cycle lane,1491.52,1541.679,939,197,fWjpJ1XIsGo,1706,https://youtu.be/fWjpJ1XIsGo?t=1491,
is there what was the sign uh was that closed yeah that's it yes the sign said cycle lane is closed which means as we're going forward you're being forced into that cycle lane and there was a nice solid line which obviously we have to now drive over you're really close to the cones on the right yeah did you notice it yeah so you got a clearance on that one with the cones because you were trying to avoid the cycle lane when we should in fact be using it at that point um then the use of mirrors change speed this was you know that zebra crossing with the lady on the other side yeah we had a bit of a harsh break come in there yeah because i realized as well there's an island there as well so it doesn't actually have to stop for her yeah and plus because of where we were even if she started like you said it's like crossing it was all right to continue with the island um your reverse park was really good,1544.88,1591.76,911,192,fWjpJ1XIsGo,1706,https://youtu.be/fWjpJ1XIsGo?t=1544,
just um i think you could have looked around a little bit more near the second half like at the very beginning lots of good looking around observational round blind spots check nobody turned up but just as we're heading back and you're kind of looking here just have a little look to the right and that's it that would have been grand um so it didn't matter that my wheels were yeah no that's all right well i mean i should so that's not actually yeah that's not actually a fault that was more of an advisory one you you were waiting there at the end you were like yeah i'm done okay yeah and then when you moved your wheel turned already yeah but yeah that's not a fault because i asked about that previously because i know i've previously marked it down as a fault yeah but that's not a fault but it was more advice where you try and get the wheel straightened um i think that's it were there any other points that stuck out for you um sorry this is reflecting on your face i've,1594.24,1640.48,980,205,fWjpJ1XIsGo,1706,https://youtu.be/fWjpJ1XIsGo?t=1594,
seen yeah um no i think it was it was okay you know just some things i think um like we mentioned earlier just a bit more planning ahead mm-hmm there were lots of other hazards we were having to deal with like that lorry for one you know what the traffic lights yeah yeah i was thinking oh have you seen the signal because the lorry signal was so small this little led little strip but yeah you noticed that you dealt with it nicely but we've had lots of things kind of developing in front of us today yeah but overall really well done okay it was a pass definitely um and the roundabouts were good with lots of them sorry lost my lid i'll have to get it later okay all right so that's the end of our mockups video today hopefully it's been useful for you guys as well don't forget to like the video comment down below and follow me on all my socials you've got tiktak instagram and obviously,1641.76,1698.159,892,190,fWjpJ1XIsGo,1706,https://youtu.be/fWjpJ1XIsGo?t=1641,

[Music] hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving today i'm doing a mock test with anisha now this is the first time we're driving together and you've not done a driving test before and you've been learning to drive for just over a year you said just under a year just under a year so you've had your fair share of instructors you said yeah and your test is in about um just under a month isn't it now few weeks a week about two weeks time all right so you kind of know what's involved in a mop test okay so um throughout the drive i want you to follow the road ahead whenever i need you to turn i will tell you in plenty of time if i don't say anything keep going straight if you're not sure where you're going you can ask i'm going to give you 10 minutes of independent driving which is where i'm going to give you a series of directions to kind of follow and if you,21.28,67.52,872,193,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=21,
kind of forget you can always ask all right we're gonna do one maneuver and we may also carry out the emergency stop similar to everything you've already been practicing with your instructor okay okay all right now before we get started i'm gonna ask you a quick question okay could you tell me um could you tell me about lost my question forgot about this part all right could you tell me how would you check that your brakes are working um so you apply the brake firmly um and you've got to i think you've got to make sure that the they don't feel slack or there's always they don't feel slack and okay so you can test the brakes yeah yeah okay now for anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe to the channel if you haven't already now anish are you ready to get started yep all right okay so whenever you're ready let's start the engine okay and then we'll drive off from here yeah,69.2,131.36,940,196,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=69,
you'll see throughout the drive that,164.64,164.64,36,7,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=164,
you'll see throughout the drive that anisha has a bit of a bad habit of resting her left foot over on the clutch while driving you shouldn't put your foot in this position as this does result in the clutch plates burning up over time you should rest your left foot on the left side of the clutch it's a far bigger color obviously it's actually not that big is it not it feels massive all right at the end of the road let's turn right please hi guys and thank you very much for all your support if you enjoy watching this content and actually learned something along the way don't forget to like the video share with anyone that may be learning to drive and subscribe to the channel if you haven't already and thank you for all your support when emerging right out of this t-junction anisha should also have been watching the driver that's opposite us as they were already on the main road and they were waiting to move off they did wait for us on this occasion but,164.64,226.56,964,196,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=164,
sometimes they may not notice you approaching so always look right ahead left ahead right turn left please [Music],228.239,237.72,114,21,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=228,
at the end of the road term righteous [Music] as we emerged out of this next t-junction anisha goes into second gear a bit too quickly we weren't fast enough to be in second gear so the car initially struggles with the gear change [Music] most of the area is 20 miles per hour anisha is up to the speed of the road but she's using second gear which isn't great for fuel efficiency when driving in second gear the revs are around 2000 revs at this point if you were driving in third gear the revs would be around 1.2 so about 1200 it's better to be in a higher gear so that you have better fuel efficiency especially when driving on open roads like this if you can pull over and park up on the left somewhere safe you can park up on that yellow line there [Music] thank you travis when you're ready okay [Music],260.799,358.44,810,187,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=260,
at the roundabout turn left it's the first exit [Music] anisha's got a really good speed on approach to this roundabout this gives her enough time to slow look and keep moving without needing to stop unnecessarily [Music] surely we're gonna start the independent driving from here okay i'd like you to follow signs to heathrow okay [Music] as we're going forward the vehicle in front of us now starts indicating that they're parking on this road but there is a bus on a bus stop directly in front of them so anisha doesn't realize that the learner is stopping on this road so she waits behind them she does get marked down for response to other road users for this as there was enough space to get round the learner in front doesn't wait there for too long so this doesn't give her a serious fault but she should have been prepared to go around them,374.08,440.08,849,178,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=374,
[Music] leading up to the hazard ahead anisha does check her mirrors but she doesn't indicate to go around the lorry it's a good idea to indicate that way drivers in front behind and anyone in the lorry knows that you're intending to go around [Music],459.06,480.92,251,56,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=459,
up to this point all of the roads have been 20 miles per hour and anesha has been driving between 17 to 19 miles per hour in second gear the whole time she does start to make good progress along this road but then gets to around 30 32 and continues driving along that speed for much of this road which is way too slow as it is a 40 miles per hour road so we're causing vehicles to overtake us at this point sorry i talked to myself sometimes that's okay whatever,514.08,544.08,462,104,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=514,
this does not go down as a serious fault as her speed is fluctuating and there's not a lot of traffic behind us so this is not a major fault at the moment on approach to this roundabout anisha slows down really well going through her gears and selects the left lane to follow the road ahead this will put her in a good position to take the normal driving position in the new road [Music] anisha does this roundabout really well sticking to the outskirts and signals left to exit there's a 50 miles per hour gateway sign ahead that is the new speed limit as we're going forward again she does start to make progress but she only really gets up to about 37 miles per hour and then as we're coming up to the exit she slows down even more causing her to get a serious fault for progress appropriate speed we're going to follow signs traveling on a 50 miles per hour road and driving up to about 37 is way too,572.56,644.0,904,192,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=572,
slow as this causes everyone in this lane to have to overtake us as we're going forward anisha slows down even more slowing down to about 30 miles per hour while still on the carriageway you'll have a long slip road in order to slow down so she should not have slowed down to this speed at this road driving 10 miles per hour or so under the speed limit you become a hazard on the road so everyone has to now overtake you and come out of this lane so it's not safe driving at that speed as the road is very clear yes leading up to this roundabout turn right third exit you can use the middle or the far right lane anisha uses the middle lane as this will put her in a better position to take the exit starting in the third lane would not be an issue as this would take you to your exit but you'll just be in the overtaking lane on the exit [Music] alicia does start to go into the wrong,646.48,728.48,886,199,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=646,
lane but realizes and starts checking her mirrors and safely switches back into the correct lane this is not an issue as long as it's safe to do so,730.24,737.6,147,30,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=730,
[Music] all right that'll be the end of independent driving i want to give you normal instructions from now on so shortly we're going to be making a right turn at the second set of traffic lights turn right here the second set this is the first so we're going to be turning right okay okay,773.4,796.24,289,61,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=773,
to change lanes at this position anisha should have focused on getting up to the speed of the road and then switching over which would make it a lot easier to switch lanes the van that was behind us tries to move into the overtaking lane as we're going too slowly when they realize we're switching lanes they gave way so this does go down as a minor fault for progress appropriate speed again which is a bit of a habitual fault at this point that anisha does drive too slowly [Music] yeah i don't think i've come this way before,812.72,846.8,528,110,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=812,
[Music] as we enter this new road there's a 30 miles per hour speed limit anisha continues driving up to 20 miles per hour giving her a serious fault now she's got a habitual fault for driving too slowly as she's had various miners for doing the same thing over and over [Music] now at this point she does realize it's a 30 miles per hour speed limit but she only really gets up to about 24 25 miles per hour even when the road is nice and clear and there's nothing going on this would still give you a minor fault for going too slowly if there are hazards about and you go a little bit slower than the speed limit that's not an issue but when the road is really clear and there's nothing going on and you continue driving too slow this will be a hazard [Music],864.4,920.16,761,169,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=864,
today is monday so we can use the bustling always use the bus lane as it's the position for normal driving if you're outside of the hours of operation so this bus lane reads monday to friday 7 to 10 a.m and 4 to 7 p.m and we're outside of that time at the moment [Music],944.399,976.62,270,67,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=944,
next round about i'd like you to take the third exit towards greenford leading up to the roundabout anisha should have tried to change lanes much earlier as she realized quite early on that she was taking the third exit she does use her mirrors but she's not indicating and she's not trying to move over at the point she does try and move over there is a vehicle quite close behind her they did have to adjust their speed for us so this did go down as a fault leading up to the roundabout anisha gets a serious fault for use of mirrors change direction as she's going forward in the right hand lane just before the roundabout she suddenly drifts into the left-hand lane without checking mirrors or signaling as we enter the roundabout anisha does stay in the correct lane and follows it really nicely but it's a good idea to check the left mirror in case of anybody from the left who may be straight lining the roundabout [Music],994.959,1060.41,929,191,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=994,
as elaine warren is already signposted for greenford you simply need to stick to this lane and go towards the exit once you're on the exit you can merge anisha initially tries switching lanes and this is a bit confusing as there was a vehicle on our left who hesitated because she did signal in front of them but as she didn't actually move over this was not an issue as we're coming off the roundabout in the overtaking lane anisha gets a serious fault for progress when the traffic lights go green she's picking up speed too slowly causing everyone that's in our lane to move into the left hand lane to overtake us she's coming off the roundabout around 10 miles per hour and she's trying to move back into the left all the while everyone on the left is trying to speed up [Music],1062.72,1113.59,782,168,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=1062,
that's why it's always better to be in the other lane because it gets harder when you go out in this lane [Music] all right so what we're going to do now is i'd like you to forward park into a space of your choice just make sure you finish within the okay fold back into a space of your choice,1146.16,1165.039,293,67,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=1146,
on the left you pick,1187.84,1188.88,20,5,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=1187,
okay give me one second [Music] yeah you can ask me if it's just outside the back is it not in then if the tires are in you're in the tires are in are they in i don't know all right when you're ready let's reverse that up here as you can tell that's like my scariest um maneuver okay and you're ready let's go,1285.44,1316.48,309,77,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=1285,

[Music] send me [Music] coming up to this traffic light junction it splits into two lanes but just on the other side it emerges straight away anisha does really well to use her mirrors when merging lanes and she's also making good progress at this time [Music] my head why are you crossing the road when this is ever crossing literally not far from you pedestrians are quite lazy aren't we again anisha demonstrates really good observation on this roundabout she's looking ahead looking across to the right and also steering towards the left to get a good position to start this turn she waits for a nice gap and enters the roundabout safely [Music],1380.76,1466.56,649,130,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=1380,
on the road yeah just in that space there on the road okay okay go to the side of it just take it off the pavement off the paper yeah it's fine just leave it there that's fine never go on the paper by the way oh not unless the examiner specifies all right okay whenever i thought you meant to spit and i thought the gray part are outdoor spaces but i just want you to pop oh okay all right secure the car and switch off the engine all right thank you just give me a few minutes that's the end of your driving test all right that's the end of your test how was your drive it was okay there were a couple of things i could have done better okay would you say there were any serious spots um so i know that in the last round no the second last round about i was in the wrong lane now i was not in the preferrable lane you know outside you can take two one is the best option the second one you've got to,1488.64,1550.32,900,196,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=1488,
be more careful because you're kind of you're gonna be joining on yeah so i ended up in the wrong game but i kind of like stuck with it and when it was safe i got through so i think i never dealt with it that roundabout wasn't an issue no um i know that the hillingdon one i wasn't sure which lane i was meant to be in and in terms of your roundabouts you were fine the boundaries okay there is a big bigger concern oh no okay okay you drive too slow do you say too slow so unfortunately it would have been a fail because there are so many occasions where you're just under the speed limit so when we went onto that carriageway you know where it was 40. yeah you said oh it's 40 and i thought great she's going to get on with it because before that would kind of bring a little bit something you did 35 at most and then you brought it back down to,1551.919,1600.48,847,193,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=1551,
about 30 32 and i was like this is a bit slow no one was around us at the time so it wasn't a major concern if there are other cars it would have been dangerous yeah and then we went forward and it was 50 what speed did you do when it was 50 and the highest you went up to was 37. and then when i said oh we're gonna take the exit kind of coming off at hillingdon it's still 50 yeah and we're about 27. yeah and this is when you said oh i've signaled a bit early and i thought the signal's not really not that bad because we're traveling we're supposed to be traveling yeah at that speed so the signal timing was fine it was just you're just driving too fast there were so many separate occasions besides that yeah where other cars behind us are just having to go around you all the time yeah and that's what made the drive too dangerous so you've got various miners on going too slow,1601.679,1649.84,884,202,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=1601,
and then serious and kind of a dangerous one on going to something as well yeah like overall safety-wise really good you're always checking your marriage you're always aware of your surroundings but you know that roundabout you were talking about well you said i'm in the wrong lane yeah you know you're in the overtaking lane but that lane did exit yes it was still it was fine yeah but because you were thinking oh i need to be in that lane you were going 10 11 and now everyone that was in your lane is going oh my god there's overtakes and they're going around yeah i saw someone shaking his head behind me and i was like sorry so yeah you're just driving too slow that was literally the biggest concern for me yeah besides that there was one lane change and this was coming up to white hot roundabout when you were taking the third exit for greenford yeah you were in the bus lane which is fine you're using the bus lane you checked,1651.44,1697.6,937,195,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=1651,
your mirrors and there's a car next to you and you kind of tried to make a move yeah i was going to then i saw that car was yeah not he was quite close yeah so you chose not to move over which is great you kind of held off and then he held his position and you moved over so you only got a minor on that account but then you moved over and now the roundabout's coming and you've drifted back into the left lane again and then you moved over again that's where your serious fault came in okay yeah so you know that greenfield i always get confused are you meant to be in the way no hang on white hot so your exit is after 12 o'clock right yeah just start on the right start completing the right yeah sometimes on the middle you started on the right i did right and then as you entered you were in the correct lane yeah you were following the correct lane your path was correct the whole time once you entered yeah it was the initial oh where am i and you kind,1699.12,1743.2,958,205,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=1699,
of moved around yeah that's where you what you're serious okay but besides that let's talk about a few of the other things going on not a lot going on besides that just honestly it was just your speed there was one encounter right at the beginning there was like a little learner car in front of us and there was a bus and that learner actually they stopped yeah they did now they parked or what they waited well they were still on the road though they were like yeah it was a really weird spot for them to actually park it didn't look like they parked park because they didn't thought that they would have been left so they were like and i think she was like thinking about whether to overtake or not so i just kind of waited so yeah now that one there didn't give you a serious fault because they weren't exactly in the correct position and plus the bus was there and yeah but they did signal to get to that position so you should be thinking wait did that mean they're,1744.72,1789.039,971,198,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=1744,
parking and actually they were parked oh did they signal to left to park yeah oh right how how slow so 23 24 you've got to think okay if you're on a nice open road yeah and there are no hazards and it's 30 yeah drive 30. if you were driving like 28 27 and then 28 29 that's okay i'm not going to have an issue with that you're just down here and there's nothing going on yeah but now if you take the same road but you scatter some hazards you've got a crossing you've got parked cars you've got some pedestrians yeah now your speed is fine yeah but if it's clean like yeah so the times where you've been marked down it's it's clear and you're still too slow yeah yeah okay it's the initial when you go from zero getting to that speed is slow once you're there you're kind of all right and the other thing is you'd like to,1790.159,1838.64,821,195,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=1790,
rest your left foot on the clutch yeah yeah just watching your left foot like i was like why don't you want to take it off i don't know i think i'm just in the habit of keeping it there but then this car is higher up compared to my instructor's car so i was like wait this is uncomfortable so i kept it here for a bit but i was like wait but now what i've already changed like what about exchange gear yeah you moved off in second gear a few times from stationery so you don't like changing gears either but the clutch control is good so that saved you yeah all right so how was your mock test experience i'm so glad i did it because my instructor kept saying you're not making progress but now i see actually i could fail from going to sleep yeah because it was just it popped up so many times there were points where i was thinking let me just tell her let me just tell her and then if i tell her,1839.919,1883.12,898,193,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=1839,
then it's not really mock test no but at the end of the day it could get to that point in a test where you're driving and you've made so many mistakes that the examiner has marked it as serious and it's just like all right come on let's go let's go they'll actually get you to pick up the pace now because they need to get back for the next test yeah that's how slow it got okay yeah basically right you've got time you'll see this and you able to kind of fix this so the roundabouts was like roundabouts were safe that was what i was most concerned about and the bay parking yeah but so the bay parking i think most of the time i just do it with that like i reverse that little shunt that you could get a minor footing you didn't get minor for that because you had you had to reverse but you could have easily just started further left and driven in more when you had the space covered i don't know there's a reference point that my,1884.559,1927.44,933,204,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=1884,
instructor taught me and i don't know it just it works sometimes sometimes it doesn't work i'll give you a reference i'll go over i'm going to go over i'm going to go over these points and we're going to drive a little bit now anyway so we'll fix some of this okay sounds good all right so that's the end of our mock test today hopefully that video has been useful for you guys as well and you can learn from some of anisha's there don't drive too slow guys all right now um don't forget to like the video comment down below and follow me on my socials you've got tiktok and instagram i'll try and link it here i'm really bad at this stuff but yeah bye for now [Music],1928.96,1963.09,668,154,vig58lufpwk,1964,https://youtu.be/vig58lufpwk?t=1928,

[Music] hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving today i'm doing a mock test suede tara now this is the first time we are driving together and you've traveled all the way from east london east london so she's done a long drive not drive but long travel this morning and your test is in just three days time yeah how are you feeling a bit nervous but yeah so your instructor's got the same car as this so that would make life a bit easier and you've not done a mock test and you've not done a test never but you've been driving for i think you said just under a year was it yeah i don't know on and off okay all right so we're gonna get started you kind of know what's involved in a mock test you wanna tell you um i think i know yeah okay so just gonna be following the road it's all about you driving safely it's not about being perfect if you make a few mistakes don't,26.83,75.36,875,194,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=26,
worry all right so i want you to drive straight the whole time we're gonna do one maneuver we may also carry out the emergency stop before we get started i'm to ask you a quick question could you tell me where would you find the engine oil and how do you make sure it's at the correct level the engine oil would be in if you open the bonnet and you can check if it's at the correct level if it's in between the i think max and min line okay in between that sounds good yeah that's fine um for anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe to the channel if you haven't already now we're gonna get straight into it okay so whenever you're ready i'd like you to start the engine [Music] and i'm going to give you normal instructions throughout okay yeah so drive off whenever you're ready,76.96,136.0,837,181,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=76,
oh okay double check number oh okay we're gonna make a left turn at the end of this road,151.76,186.4,88,20,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=151,
[Music] the road ahead is not wide enough for two vehicles to pass as there are part vehicles on both sides so when this is the case you need to position your vehicle in the center of the road tyra manages to space really well especially when the road gets a bit tighter she slows down and goes back into first gear when driving through narrow spaces like this always check your mirrors and be aware of your surroundings tyra does this really well [Music],214.25,248.94,455,91,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=214,
at the end of the road turn left please [Music] tyra's got a really good routine with her feet she uses the brake until she's slow putting the clutch down very close to the end of the road as she stops she selects first gear to start again,266.56,278.96,239,53,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=266,
okay we're going to start the independent drive from here i'd like you to follow signs towards rice lip we're following the road ahead on the roundabout which is the second exit tyra signals right before she enters which gives her a minor fault for unnecessary use of signals she also nearly gets a serious fault on the entry of the roundabout the vehicle on the roundabout had they been any faster this would have given her a serious fault,299.759,321.84,440,87,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=299,
when exiting a roundabout always use your mirrors towards the left and signal left to exit this did not go down as a minor fault as we were already in the left hand lane but if you have to switch lanes you should always check your mirrors tyra is using third gear when driving down this road now being in third gear you're definitely going to be more fuel efficient but it's very easy to go over the speed limit so you only want to press down on the accelerator by a little bit to maintain the speed tyra does go over the speed briefly on this road but she does control it very quickly she does get a minor fault for this [Music] so,338.96,388.8,632,132,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=338,
whenever tara waits at a traffic light or at the end of a road she's got a habit of putting the car into hold this is quite similar to having the parking brake on while waiting with the hold she brings the clutch up to the biting point and anytime she needs to move off she presses the accelerator to release the hold now we're doing this it's not a mistake in terms of a driving test but it will burn out the clutch plates over time as you're waiting on the biting point the whole time you should wait with the clutch down fully and only bring the clutch up to the biting point when you wish to move off most new cars tend to alter a rev so you can hear that the biting point is quite high,407.28,442.88,690,146,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=407,
before leaving a roundabout always check your mirrors to the left and signal left that you're exiting the roundabout as we're exiting we're in the right hand lane so we need to merge on the exit as the two lanes merge on the exit you need to merge and turn there was a vehicle close behind but tyra deals with this really well the truck behind us starts overtaking at this point and this is a prime example of where you should not overtake you should never overtake anyone on zigzag lines of a pedestrian crossing like you'll follow signs towards central london now for a little while,486.72,521.519,584,119,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=486,
leading up to this roundabout tyra dust position on the right to make the right turn but she indicates quite late as we're traveling at 40 miles per hour aim to signal between 8 to 10 car lengths making sure there are no entrances before the one you're taking,537.12,549.12,259,56,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=537,
as we're going around the roundabout this is now the second exit that's ahead of us at this point tyra should have checked her mirrors and gone into the outside lane as you pass the exit that way you can exit more easily at the point that she does move into the left lane it could be an issue if somebody enters a roundabout from exit number two and we're trying to exit the roundabout at the exact same time tyra does make really good progress on the slip road but as we're going forward she doesn't realize that it's a slip road where she has to change lanes by the end she thinks it's a new lane being added leading up to the end of the slip road the lorry that was in the lane next to us started flashing their headlights to get our attention that they're giving away but tara didn't signal at this point and didn't notice this,565.36,608.0,831,179,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=565,
still following central london okay still following central the speed is now changing from 50 to 40 miles per hour tara does step off the accelerator to slow down but as we're going downhill this doesn't help so she needs to break to slow down and bring down the speed quicker we're now at the end of our independent drive zatara needs to carry on driving as normal on the left there's a sign which shows us that there's a new lane being added so the middle lane now becomes the position for overtaking rather than normal driving so tyra needs to move back into the left-hand lane she doesn't realize that first and carries on driving in the middle lane for a little while but she's at the speed of the road as soon as she realizes she starts checking her mirrors and moves back straight away so this did not go down as a fault as nobody was going out of their way to overtake her,629.92,698.399,880,184,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=629,
we're going to take the exit coming off here and at the roundabout i'd like you to turn right into the third exit as we came off the slip road tara moved into the right hand lane without indicating now the signal wasn't necessary as nobody was actually around us she carries out smooth progressive braking to stop by the end and switches straight back into first gear third exit yes third exit as we enter the roundabout tara can go into the middle or the far right lane as they both have a right arrow she goes into the far right lane which makes it harder for her to exit the roundabout [Music] so at this point we should have been checking the mirrors towards the left and moving into the middle lane under the bridge but tara stays in the third lane which is now supposed to be going back round the roundabout [Music] she did realize this fairly quickly and it was safe to switch lanes so she could have even switched lanes at this point,717.44,793.279,941,193,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=717,
instead of going back round the roundabout so,795.12,807.6,45,9,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=795,
[Music] tara stopped in second gear and didn't realize this so as she moves off she's now moving off in second gear now this is not a fault as long as the engine does not switch off,823.58,840.88,181,42,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=823,
as we're going around the roundabout from this point tyra needs to now be checking her mirrors to the left again to go into the left-hand lane under the bridge but she continues going round in the middle lane now this is not an issue again as we can exit from this lane but it just makes it harder as we now need to switch towards the left lane as we exit,862.8,880.32,355,76,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=862,
as we're going forward we're now entering a 20 miles per hour zone as you enter a new road there'll be gateway signs if the speed limit has changed tyra doesn't realize this and she continues driving up to 26 miles per hour it's too much,896.72,913.36,237,54,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=896,

if you can pull over and park on the right hand side of the road don't worry about the driveways in this occasion just anywhere on the right is fine [Music] thank you that's great natalia okay what i'd like you to do now is to reverse back for the length of sorry i'd like you to reverse back for about two collets keeping a reasonable distance from the pavement and try not to touch the curb as you do this okay before starting to reverse always look around checking both blind spots making sure that nobody is close to your vehicle tara carries out this exercise really nicely but as we're reversing on a downhill slope the car reverses back fairly quickly so it's a good idea to use the foot brake to slow the car down she is checking over her shoulders but not so much over her right blind spot this did not go down as a fault as she was checking and it was clear throughout that's fine thank you drive off when you're ready,1057.12,1128.799,928,195,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=1057,

and then turn left [Music] so [Music] if you can pull in and park up on the lip just before the blue pump just by this tree here will be nice by the tree and just come in a little bit will not be great thank you all right secure the car and you can switch off the engine as well all right thank you just give me a few minutes all right so that's the end of your driving test how was your drive today it was all right yeah so what happened when we were joining the uh dual carriageway the thing is i thought it was in its own separate lane that's why i was taking long to join the dual carriageway yeah but then when i was getting closer to the end i saw it going at an angle so that oh my god i need to yeah now there was a lorry next to you before you moved over he was flashing his lights quite a few times getting your attention that you know come in i'm,1307.28,1400.08,857,196,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=1307,
giving you away and now it's getting right up to the end like you said it was cutting in and we're getting closer and now your attention's gone on the lorry and now i had to take control at that point okay so how would you know if it was its own lane there's usually that sign kind of i'll put it in the video at this point but there's usually that sign which kind of goes in at an angle and then straightens up and the other two lanes are running up oh yeah i know what you mean yeah whereas it was it was just a slip road coming in to join the carriageway okay um it's quite a long slip road as well so yeah that was a bit of an issue there then also we've had use of speed what speed were you driving on that 20 road i think it was like 24. yeah you went 26 by the time i told you really yeah,1401.84,1443.679,795,188,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=1401,
so you're up to 26 i thought okay if she hits about 25 and carries on i'm gonna tell her so yeah you went to 25 26 and i had to tell you but before that is all there were two three other points where you did go over 20 zones yeah i realized that yeah so you need to control that speed a little bit um let's talk about some of the other kind of hairy moments that i thought you could have done a little bit better your junction observation on two of the roundabouts we kind of moved in one of them was a gap where i was thinking that's not looking good was that bmw coming on your right walk it was one of the first roundabouts where we went right slip oh yeah so we were in the right lane and before entering you've put on a right signal to go straight we didn't need a right signal oh yeah when you go across the run yeah so you got a miner for your signal correctly at that point and then as you entered there was a bmw already,1447.039,1493.76,929,209,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=1447,
entering and it was quite a close call and but he didn't react badly and they kind of carried on as normal so it wasn't that bad so it went down as a minor on that count but it was a kind of like a why are we doing this and then the next one was um on another big roundabout we were having to give way and go and there's a big lorry approaching again it's not like oh you shouldn't take it it's just the lorry's coming at speed you've just come in and gone out of his path and then he's had to he's carried on but it's just like oh either go earlier and quicker or just wait for a safer you're really good at with your gears kind of getting up to the next gear which is great um i want to talk about some of your habits that you have oh let's talk about sorry let's talk about the emergency stop how's the emergency stop quite hot racing i think sorry,1495.679,1543.6,851,196,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=1495,
that eventually stopped god i did not expect that i was thinking she's probably gonna break sharp she's gonna like really go for it and he did so in terms of like an emergency stop for a test great you did stop the car but did you realize the abs weren't off do you know what the abs is oh wait wait wait i actually remembered this like 30 minutes ago so it's the anti-lock braking system so when you stamp on the brake you break really quite sharp the brake pad comes into contact with the brake disc and they lock up and you lose grip of the rope surface which is what happened and the abs the job is it kind of breaks that connection between the two and then reapplies the break which is why it jutted a little bit you heard that noise so that's what that was um and doing an emergency stop and the abs going off is not an issue but you're going to get a much more effective stop if it doesn't go off,1544.4,1598.0,903,194,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=1544,
so what you want to do with the break is you want to break firm progressive but firm oh yeah okay so let's talk about you know your habit of using the hold okay that's to so you every time you stop you kind of put the hold on which is fine because that's in your instructor's car but then you've put the hold on and you kind of lift the clutch up don't you but you're waiting at a red light with your clutch half up now why is that an issue why do you think that would be an issue okay well having the clutch up like that your clutch plates are ready to go so it's more wear and tear you're kind of burning them bringing them to that point but because the hold is on the car won't let you move off so the plates are ready and the car's ready but the traffic lights are just red so in terms of wear and tear on the clutch plates it's not good practice for you yeah to do that because it's going to burn up,1600.799,1655.2,904,202,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=1600,
the clutch plates over time um if you know you're waiting you might as well wait with the clutch down philly or even in in neutral some people like to wait like that yes cause i kind of learnt like that it's because they always say like okay get me get ready yeah so it's just for you generally like with my car i'm probably with your instructor's car as well when you bring the clutch up even a little bit the car starts to rev you can hear it can't you okay so you're waiting a red light in the car's revving so it's just wasting fuel especially with the economy right now do you really want to be doing that so wait with the clutch down brake on or hold on doesn't matter and then as soon as you want to go that's when you want to balance and get that position again it's just not something that the examiner is going to talk about this is more for you yeah because when you get in your own car afterwards you don't,1656.559,1698.48,918,199,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=1656,
really want to be doing these things do you i mean my dad's a mechanic okay well let me know we can sort the clutch out yeah okay um not much else like you're a really good driver you know what you're doing you're really getting on with it signs keeping up with speeds and stuff all good you even move back into the normal driving position when you realize you're in the overtaking lane yeah you held off a little bit and then you realized so it was good it clicked in when i saw the joining the joining uh i don't know what you call it but anyone coming in here i'm in the overtaking name because it didn't because my instructor told me when it has different uh destinations it's fine but when it doesn't and it all goes to the same place yes that's it so if there's no signs that's normal um and then we had to go around greenfield around about a few times didn't we yep so you know when you realized you were,1699.84,1748.799,911,199,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=1699,
like oh i'm in the wrong lane i thought great she realizes at that point all you needed to do was just check your left side and it was empty okay you could have just switched over because we went right next to the exit but it was fine you went back round that was completely fine but you moved off three times in second gear at that roundabout you know there is a little bit of a habit of mine as long as it works it doesn't matter yeah so as long as you don't actually switch off in second gear i was like oh it's gonna go it's gonna go but no you had a good habit of actually controlling it so that was good that you were using the accelerator but every car's different so be careful with that as well yeah so overall not a lot you need to sort out so good luck with your test i hope it goes well how was the mock test experience for you i think having this experience is loki kind of prepared me for what is,1750.24,1801.44,910,196,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=1750,
gonna happen in my actual test so i think we're gonna go away today i'm gonna ask my instructor can we do a mock test again i think it was beneficial definitely yeah okay well really well done for today and thank you for being on the channel thanks for having me thank you for everyone that's been watching to hopefully tyro's block test has been useful for you guys as well don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe to the channel if you haven't already and you can add me on my socials i've got them in the description box so they're down there but yeah thank you and bye for now really well done [Music],1804.48,1840.57,628,134,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=1804,
choose what you feel [Music] okay you ready okay hi guys welcome back to clearview driving today i'm doing another driving lesson with millie now today's lesson is a little bit different so last lesson we kind of recapped over roundabouts still carriageways slip roads how are you feeling about all that yeah i mean still a bit nervous about some of the roundabouts okay so we're gonna go up a notch today yeah it's gonna be mock test style driving so we're gonna start off with um kind of like 10 to 15 minutes and then go over the 10 to 15 minutes and then go again okay so the main criteria today is about getting you to be a bit more independent doing everything on your own okay okay so i'm going to give you instructions like with turning left or right mini roundabouts traffic lights and things like that but um i want you to do everything independently okay if you forget any mirror tracks any position changes any sudden break,7.52,77.52,935,195,EqiJVzrw8fQ,1996,https://youtu.be/EqiJVzrw8fQ?t=7,
anything of the sort if there's any errors i'm not going to say anything okay you might see me taking me after notes and stuff yeah you might see me taking some notes and we'll kind of talk about it later so it's like mock test criteria okay but like a mini mark right okay okay all right so for anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe to the channel if you haven't already and we're going to get straight into it so when you're ready i'm nervous now okay okay so whenever you're ready drive off from here [Music] anytime you're moving your position in the road you should always check your mirrors in this case millie didn't check but she'd only just moved off so this wasn't an issue it's only going to be a bigger issue if somebody had been there,79.119,139.84,806,173,EqiJVzrw8fQ,1996,https://youtu.be/EqiJVzrw8fQ?t=79,

[Music] at the end of this road turn right please millie shows really good awareness and planning as there are parked vehicles on the right hand side of the road she moves over to the far left so the oncoming traffic can easily get through the middle this right turn is onto quite a busy road there's constant traffic on the new road when there are gaps on the right hand side of the road millie needs to emerge half out and then the left hand side tends to give way she carries on waiting and i had to prompt her to go at this point she did get a minor fault for this,556.28,598.959,568,120,EqiJVzrw8fQ,1996,https://youtu.be/EqiJVzrw8fQ?t=556,
although it may seem like we have been here for a little while now there have been no opportunities we could have taken as the traffic on the main road is too fast even though some of the cars from the right were turning into the junction where we're waiting the second car behind was too fast in order to be able to move forward and the traffic behind us is quite patient at the moment as they can also see that there have been no gaps at the moment after this silver car there was a big gap on the right and the vehicle approaching was signaling to turn left we should have moved half at this point you need to go halfway okay i don't but then i'm gonna block when one side's clear go half are you sure yeah okay so one of those rows you're never gonna go otherwise so go half now okay does that make sense yeah okay ahead of us on the right you can see a demonstration from the black car that moves half into the junction as the,646.959,727.76,931,192,EqiJVzrw8fQ,1996,https://youtu.be/EqiJVzrw8fQ?t=646,
right hand side of the road is clear and once they're in this position as the traffic ahead of us moves through they can come in even though the bus has turned up the bus driver could see them the whole time so it's not as if they moved in front of the bus [Music],729.6,744.67,264,59,EqiJVzrw8fQ,1996,https://youtu.be/EqiJVzrw8fQ?t=729,
just ahead of us there is a bus that's on a bus stop now millie can't see the bus as it's in the distance and the van ahead is blocking our view although millie did notice the bus quite late she deals with it really nicely by staying in the left lane and waiting for a safe gap on the right,810.399,824.0,290,66,EqiJVzrw8fQ,1996,https://youtu.be/EqiJVzrw8fQ?t=810,
the van that was directly behind us also started moving towards the right lane but when they saw millie signal they did start to slow down and flash their headlights to give way millie just reacted a little bit slower following the road ahead around the world okay second exit [Music],848.72,863.19,284,55,EqiJVzrw8fQ,1996,https://youtu.be/EqiJVzrw8fQ?t=848,
this point is usually the make or break in a driving test when you know you've made a mistake you need to carry on do not think about what's just happened carry on driving safely and up to the speed of the road [Music] i need you to maintain the composure [Music] all right now the second set of traffic lights we're gonna turn right they're coming up shortly okay turn right that's the second one second one coming up yeah at this point mini does get marked down for progress but this is not a major fault as there's nobody around us and nobody's affected by this [Music],878.88,929.55,572,123,EqiJVzrw8fQ,1996,https://youtu.be/EqiJVzrw8fQ?t=878,
okay so how was that driving really bad okay why was it really bad what happened because i was stressed out and i just i don't know yeah pretty much just all right so can i say there was just there was just one hairy moment which was that junction where you know where you're waiting i was waiting yeah because i was just yeah but the good thing about that one is it wouldn't be a serious still because the person behind us was very patient and plus it really wasn't like a clear gap for you to go in i mean i know now i will do it next time i think i'm just really hesitant to go into the middle i don't know why but you could see why you need it yeah i know yeah so on that on that junction we got um hesitation but overall that would have been a pass okay okay so there wasn't a lot going on right okay but you know the first half of that drive you only had like one fault really in the,970.48,1017.199,889,193,EqiJVzrw8fQ,1996,https://youtu.be/EqiJVzrw8fQ?t=970,
second half was it that junction or was it like that well the first thought was actually when i asked you to stop the first time oh we were stopped a bit too far yeah but you know when you said i'm gonna reverse it you should have just kind of gone forward okay a little bit i was just looking at the driveways yeah there was another big space in fact just roll into the next place yeah yeah okay so there's that then there was um the junction hesitation that's the fault coming in and then after that junction we had a few faults come in and i'm gonna go over those now okay um there was a you know that when i asked you to park up the second time we kind of touched the curb a little bit didn't you yeah we did yeah i know it wasn't that bad like it was just like a little little nudge and it was so slow and controlled that it wouldn't like kind of be enough to be a fault as such but i just thought yeah,1019.6,1064.32,907,198,EqiJVzrw8fQ,1996,https://youtu.be/EqiJVzrw8fQ?t=1019,
let's try and gradually come on yeah yeah okay yeah um okay so at that junction you've come out i kind of prompted you a little bit by the end just because we're waiting then we're going through that road now did you notice that bus pulling over you couldn't see that bus pull over right you know when that fan in front of you suddenly changed yeah no yeah that was my bad i should have been watching but it was it's only if you know the road that you know that bus is going to be there okay but it's okay yeah i know next time i know how to deal with it better because i should have waited for the person that before i started indicating because then they stopped for me no it's okay that they stopped for you yeah so with that like you said you should have checked and see what he's doing before signaling um but he was the one that was directly behind you yeah and so he had only just moved over so as soon as he saw your,1066.0,1109.039,924,197,EqiJVzrw8fQ,1996,https://youtu.be/EqiJVzrw8fQ?t=1066,
signal he thought yeah let me give it away so he wasn't like yeah so you've got your control on gears and um yeah you got a little bit flustered but he was quite patient to wait okay but you know when we stalled and we're in that position i'm gonna just kind of got that confirmation check and then go in okay so check again because they might have wanted to go yeah that's it and then when we went forward now you got yourself really flustered now the roundabout's coming and all of a sudden it was like wait where am i going am i in the right lane i know i was just like and i think that was from the stall wasn't it because i was just like oh my god and i was like okay now i've got a roundabout and my brain was still okay yeah yeah yeah so the roundabout itself you did fine okay okay but after the roundabout you were a bit slow okay do you know what the speed on that road was it was this one the one,1110.4,1150.24,907,205,EqiJVzrw8fQ,1996,https://youtu.be/EqiJVzrw8fQ?t=1110,
just before this 40. and i was getting too slow yeah that's why i was like because i saw the sign afterwards i was like oh my god yeah no so you got mark down for progress but the great thing is there really was nobody behind us okay so again it's not like we caused anyone any inconvenience just to be more just gonna get on with it yeah just kind of once you're there you're there okay cool so overall not a lot going on okay well done but don't let yourself get flustered from a stall okay well like that hesitation so i'd just get like a miner for a stall if i was okay and if it wasn't really dangerous like if you stall and you take way too long to recover okay that's now concerning so let's say that fans waiting for you and now you're taking too long and by the time you're moving he's moving or you've not checked again it just depends on how,1152.4,1197.44,852,189,EqiJVzrw8fQ,1996,https://youtu.be/EqiJVzrw8fQ?t=1152,
you kind of deal with it and um who's around you and how they're affected because at that time i feel like i didn't take like loads of time but then also at the same time obviously it was a bit annoying because he was moving and i was like kind of blocking his work and i was kind of half out you weren't half out you were in your lane okay so you didn't you didn't actually move in front of him you simply you were checking and signaling yeah but he chose to give you away okay okay all right so can we start with a nice clean sheet and go again okay yeah yeah but how was it driving independently not not having any guidance i don't know i'm i'm right now i want you to have faith in yourself you did do really well you can't give up at a hurdle and suddenly something's in front of you you're like oh i don't know what i'm doing now okay yeah yeah you did well okay okay yeah all right there were,1199.52,1247.6,899,199,EqiJVzrw8fQ,1996,https://youtu.be/EqiJVzrw8fQ?t=1199,
loads of mini roundabouts she did them all really well nothing really going on in the mini roundabouts really confident keeping up with speed meeting situations all that stuff was good no clearance faults at all really so there's a lot of good things yeah i'm only mentioning like the little bits we could improve okay cool all right so you ready for yeah okay going for round number two all right so when you're ready let's begin okay dry off when you're ready,1249.52,1276.96,461,91,EqiJVzrw8fQ,1996,https://youtu.be/EqiJVzrw8fQ?t=1249,

if millie had waited a little bit earlier it would have been a lot easier for the cars in front to be able to get through with more speed as they'd have more space in order to get around the bus it's a good idea to signal to make it clear to drivers in front and behind and also the bus driver so going ahead okay [Music],1317.679,1337.75,321,72,EqiJVzrw8fQ,1996,https://youtu.be/EqiJVzrw8fQ?t=1317,

thank you secure the car you can switch off the engine okay all right how are you feeling um how was that second drive um i'm not sure if i was unsafe on the roundabout like i knew more did you think it was unsafe i just the first bit because the first time i went on the big roundabout um i was just worried you were gonna say that i like went with the other car but because you looked yeah there was a big gap but i was just like because that other guy's gone i thought that you'd think like it was like but i could see you looked and you found the gap and the other car happened to take the gap because they were all coming through yeah it was like properly busy and i was like oh my god because you know what you don't come yeah you were actually confident with that gap so i can't fault you one yeah okay it's only if you're completely shielded and you're just like oh let me go it was,1674.64,1726.799,890,195,EqiJVzrw8fQ,1996,https://youtu.be/EqiJVzrw8fQ?t=1674,
kind of like behind me and i was like i don't know how to think that i've done that i could see the round about myself so i knew the gap you were taking it's only an issue if you know like with these roundabouts because it's got like a curved line like this so you're all kind of staggered yeah it's only if they're ahead of you and now you can't actually see and you're just facing your decisions a little bit yeah okay exactly i've got no complaints yeah yeah okay roundabouts really well done um again it would be a pass it was just there was a bit of a hairy moment on one of them yeah it was just to do with your mirror checks okay you know on willow tree the second time around when we went right um was it the so the third exit did you see that white car on your left audi a3 um no actually you did check yeah i was there i'm trying to remember,1728.32,1771.679,851,192,EqiJVzrw8fQ,1996,https://youtu.be/EqiJVzrw8fQ?t=1728,
yeah okay so what happened is we're on the roundabout okay again it's not like it's a major concern because you're in your lane you're coming off the roundabout as you're coming off we're in the middle lane yeah coming off a roundabout where there are three lanes now from the middle your lane was merging with the right lane and you're checking the left mirror oh do you mean unless we came off yeah i actually went on there and i was like this is literally on the exit yeah okay so on the exit as we're coming off um your attention should be on that right side and just kind of getting off and getting that speed but i was looking your attention was over there i always do that on that part as well because i'm always worried about who's there but i just need to like get over there yeah and i can move back over when it's safe but again with the other car he was kind of just carrying on in his path it just felt like we were encroaching yeah,1773.919,1820.88,945,204,EqiJVzrw8fQ,1996,https://youtu.be/EqiJVzrw8fQ?t=1773,
i'm not sure if we were completely over but it just felt like we were kind of encroaching you just kind of focus in your lane and getting on with it yeah we can deal with the lane change later yeah yeah okay um so over here i don't know this felt like a bit of hesitation before that bus and then um you happen to move off in second i was like i love please don't stall because it's uphill and there's a lorry i know it was bad but again as long as you don't stall it's not an issue i know i did that a few times i was like i think i was so concentrated on someone i was like wait yeah i know yeah i'll just keep every time just keep checking and go back too fast that's it yeah you did the roundabouts really well lane discipline wise but on all the roundabouts i just felt like you could be a bit more aware of your surroundings a bit more visual yeah as you enter checking yep this side,1821.679,1870.88,889,200,EqiJVzrw8fQ,1996,https://youtu.be/EqiJVzrw8fQ?t=1821,
it's purely just mirror checks we could we could add a few more of them in just being more cautious of people around you yeah the reverse in here control wise really nice got it in the space nicely your back right tires slightly closer but it's okay not an issue you're in the space but at the very beginning you know when you decided to go forward and back yeah because i was i was trying to work out which line i was using when i ended up using that one yeah i was just like so that's okay but now that you've put it in reverse gear again you should have had a 360 check oh yeah sorry so that's what let me down but again this is my chat as well it's yeah you didn't check afterwards but it's just like halfway through you're like oh yeah yeah okay so anytime you change directions you you look before you change direction that's it okay okay so you can relax now we're done okay so for our first first attempt kind of mock,1872.72,1922.64,925,198,EqiJVzrw8fQ,1996,https://youtu.be/EqiJVzrw8fQ?t=1872,
test style driving how did you feel um i felt like i did worse than you're saying i did so it's a good thing then i mean like i felt like i did i thought i messed up a lot more but i'm quite happy with the roundabouts in the end yeah like that i was able to do it without you telling me with the roundabouts i was trying to make sure that we kind of approached the roundabouts from a different angle where you're seeing them and going different directions from what we've done in the last one because i don't want you to just kind of use what you know and yeah i know how to take this one that's why i was trying to go from different like taking the different exits just kind of vary up a little bit but really well done okay okay all right well that's the end of our video today i'm gonna look so stressed but after this we're gonna be able to we're gonna need to go more we're gonna,1924.72,1968.799,884,196,EqiJVzrw8fQ,1996,https://youtu.be/EqiJVzrw8fQ?t=1924,
continue with mock tests from here on but we do need to cover over our maneuvers which we haven't done in a little while so maybe we'll review the uh maneuvers in the next one and then go back to noctus yeah fully yeah i think so but you're ready no i'm joking yeah maybe all right well thank you for everyone that's been watching and that's a bye from classified that's buy from us now so bye [Music],1970.399,1994.94,401,89,EqiJVzrw8fQ,1996,https://youtu.be/EqiJVzrw8fQ?t=1970,
[Music] hi guys welcome back to clearview driving today i'm doing a mock test with mateo now we've been doing lessons for a little while we've done about three or four sessions together yeah we have and you've done one driving test uh it did not go very well yes you had one serious fault but you know exactly what that fault was yeah and i have a sneaky suspicion we're going to go with that later but yeah later yeah definitely but we're going to try out a challenging route in the area that he's got his test coming up and uh see how he gets odd with a full mock test start to finish cool um all right so you know what's involved in a mock test you're gonna go over uh it's gonna be drive around for a bit do a maneuver and then independent driving and then maybe an emergency stop yeah that's basically it yeah so everything you're already kind of used to we're gonna um come back,20.79,71.84,884,191,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=20,
one second yeah so everything you actually i would amateur level productions literally yeah okay so everything that you're already used to and we're gonna get started now before we get started i'm going to ask you a quick question yeah would you tell me how would you check that your brakes are working before starting your journey you would uh drive very slowly and press them down make sure they don't feel spongy or slack okay perfect so when you're ready i'd like you to start the engine and we're gonna move off right,72.88,105.6,522,104,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=72,
hi guys i just wanted to say a massive thank you to everyone that's been supporting my channel don't forget to like the video comment and subscribe i hope you all enjoy watching these videos and learn something along the way at the mini roundabout turn right [Music],122.159,142.77,266,53,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=122,
mateo does know the size of his vehicle really well so he is able to position quite well through the narrow space but he does take a bit of a risky gap with a silver part car ahead giving him a clearance fault going through smaller spaces always aim to leave a meter of space all around your vehicle so the smaller the space the slower you go roundabout turn left it's the first exit okay [Music],165.44,215.09,396,82,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=165,
so [Music] if you can pull over and park up on the left somewhere safe [Music] oh these ones doesn't matter if you park something you're not supposed to like a single gun i think you drive up when you're ready [Music] in your driving test when the examiner asks you to pull over and park somewhere safe that means you need to make sure that you're not parked in front of a driveway or on a single yellow line you can park in one of these bays if they say it's okay in front of the yellow line then you can also park there but try and avoid driveways going into a right-hand bend with parked vehicles on the right hand side of the road try and position more towards the left so oncoming traffic have space through the middle of the road,236.159,306.639,735,159,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=236,
matteo deals with the situation ahead really well by slowing down checking his mirrors and moving towards the right in advance so that he doesn't get too close at the roundabout turn left first exit,323.28,333.52,198,39,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=323,
[Music] okay so what we're going to do now is we're going to start the independent driving from here okay so i'm going to give you a series of directions to follow okay as we go down this road when we get to the roundabout i'd like you to turn right it's the fourth exit okay and then we're going to follow some signs towards stains okay okay so when you're ready,359.15,381.919,363,82,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=359,
as we've been waiting at temporary traffic lights it's a good idea to check your mirrors in case of any motorbikes or cyclists that may catch up with you at the time [Music] this is the lovely smell of isaway this is the lovely smell of isolate [Music] oh [Music] yeah when you show his eyes,407.12,456.96,291,67,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=407,
mateo does approach the roundabout with a right indicator as we enter the roundabout the signal does turn off he should have reapplied it but this does not go down as a serious fault [Music] sign sustains right yes when following road signs if there are no signs for the direction that you're following you need to keep following the road ahead [Music],484.0,522.95,352,73,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=484,
mateo starts the right turn on the roundabout really nicely by signaling right positioning on the right and following the white line to the left of him as he gets past the second exit he goes into the overtaking lane on the carriageway now this is not a fault as he makes good progress he moves back into the left hand lane when it's safe to do so you don't want to rush back into the left lane and slow everybody down [Music],549.12,572.15,426,93,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=549,
if you ever find yourself in the overtaking lane make sure to make good progress and get back into the normal driving position you're only a hazard if you're being slow while in the overtaking lane or if you continue to drive in the overtaking lane when you're not overtaking any traffic even if you have to turn right at around about in two miles you should switch back into the left-hand lane and switch back towards the right when you're closer to your junction so when you start to see that the roundabout is approaching or it's within six seven hundred yards you can start looking to move over if it's safe,590.32,619.44,611,125,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=590,
[Music] when exiting a roundabout always check your mirrors and signal left that you're leaving towards the left on this occasion mateo doesn't get a minor fault as the lane that we're in doesn't go anywhere else but it's a good idea to always check your mirrors and signal as you exit okay that'll be the end of your independent driving i'm going to give you directions normal from now on okay we're going to take the exit coming off that heathrow,654.13,684.16,448,96,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=654,
at the roundabout to the left is the first exit [Music] as we get to the top of the roundabout the van on the right hand side is completely blocking our view matteo can't see anything at this point he does take a bit of a risky gap he moves in as the van moves in the van is simply crossing the first lane whereas we're actually moving into the first lane so had a vehicle been approaching this would have been a serious or dangerous fault so don't enter the roundabout if you cannot see it's not worth it especially not with a van like this [Music] turn left,716.24,782.88,559,122,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=716,
because what we're going to do now is i'd like you to reverse into a space of your choice make sure you just finish within the white lines of the bay so reverse into either side can i go around no i'm just here anywhere is fine,799.04,814.72,227,50,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=799,
okay thank you drive off when you're ready so it's one with so much gonna follow around [Music] i'm now realizing follow it round was not this what's this should we go i think we shall and then just turn right in here yes and then just left out here and then left again at the end,870.32,925.76,280,63,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=870,
[Music],944.96,944.96,7,3,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=944,
driving down this road mateo does get marked down for progress appropriate speeds as it is a 30 miles per hour road but due to the parked cars on the trees it's not safe to fully go up to 30 he should be driving up to about 25 miles per hour he thinks it's a 20 miles per hour zone at this point we're also not holding up any traffic at this point either as no one is behind [Music] mateo is traveling slow for the speed of this road but as there are parked vehicles on the left hand side and we're having to cross over the center line this would not be a major fault if this had been a 20 miles per hour road you will see signs throughout the road whether they're on the floor on the sides you will also see traffic calming measures as a reminder traffic lights turn left please [Music] as we enter the new road there are signs on the floor and on the sides to remind,966.48,1038.079,868,193,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=966,
us we're now entering a 20 zone after this point there will be signs throughout the road as a reminder whenever you're driving if you see a bus lane always make sure to read the time on the signboard the bus lane here is monday to friday seven to ten a.m and four to seven pm we're outside of those hours so we're allowed to use the bus lane this did not go down as a fault as the road's not very long and nobody went out of their way to overtake us at the next round about term right that exit [Music],1040.079,1071.79,502,114,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=1040,
as we're turning right onto a dual carriage wave the road marking naturally puts us into the overtaking lane on the exit mateo does check his mirrors but he forgets to change his signal so as he exits the roundabout he's still got a right indicator but switches into the left hand lane he gets marked down for this,1096.799,1112.88,314,65,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=1096,
when it's safe to do so i'd like you to demonstrate how you would wash the front windscreen thank you when traveling above 30 miles per hour always make sure to maintain at least a two second gap from the vehicle ahead [Music],1140.4,1167.99,226,49,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=1140,
about the next round about the left is the first exit,1193.28,1195.2,53,11,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=1193,
you [Music],1219.84,1231.27,11,4,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=1219,
take the next road on your left left again in here,1248.88,1262.08,50,11,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=1248,
just keep driving forward [Music] now if you can just drive forward into any space on your right it doesn't need to be perfectly in the space this is not part of your test what's wrong thank you secure the car and switch off the engine okay brilliant if you give me a few minutes all right how was your drive i think i think i failed and i think i know where okay tell me i think he was leaving leaving the roundabout i was following the mini and i changed lanes like indicating and that was that was anyone there nobody nobody was there okay but i think i think there is yeah i think yeah it was still changing lanes without indicating and that was that well you'd be pleased to know that that would be a pass really yeah really that was a really good drive fair enough um i've got a few minor faults i thought i thought for sure i felt that well yeah i realized i saw you react your reaction at that point i was so annoyed bro,1290.72,1365.6,928,193,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=1290,
because i was like i i literally thought because i was in the wrong lane yeah i wasn't i was in the wrong lane but i should have like i don't know how i messed up but i should have been on the left i wasn't with that particular roundabout what happened is when we're turning right it naturally takes you into that into that lane yeah exactly and so anyway okay i'm in the other lane i'll just firm it and with the mini i trusted the mini should not have trusted it that meant it was fine to switch you just didn't signal that's all yeah that's it luckily doesn't it you did check your mirrors which is great if you hadn't checked your mirrors that would have been without even that yeah yeah okay thank god every single one of them no it's because it's because my old teacher was absolutely like on it yeah like she was strict about that that's good so let me go over some of the other faults so,1367.28,1412.24,895,192,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=1367,
the the main faults for me that stuck out from all but if i haven't got many i've only got five i've got two main faults that stuck out for me one was clearance which was the very first driving fault this was um the very first road and there was a parked car on the left there's a lerner park opposite it's quite a narrow little space and you've just kind of carried on it felt quite close to the parked car on the left okay so if you know it's a tighter space hashtag slower yeah so that was the very first fault clearance and the second fault which kind of didn't like after we did the maneuver um we're driving down this road stains road was it thirty it's the i knew it was a thirty i was i was i was looking at every single because you know how it's the thirteen on the side of the twenty i was like this doesn't smell right it doesn't smell right but i thought i'd rather take i'd rather take,1413.36,1456.48,898,198,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=1413,
the 20 in the 30 than the 13 and 20 so i just found it so yeah you kept driving 23. you didn't go 22 23 yeah because i like as in i was really done with that because i went 22 which is it's speeding if it's a 20 and it's too slow for the 30s it was the worst of both of them so yeah because you were you were going over that limit and then you kind of bring it back down and then yeah because i was that's what saved you really but without having a serious if i tried to tell you i'm serious if it was absolutely clear when you're doing 20 the whole time it was pretty it was pretty it was pretty crystal clear cars on the left the whole time and we had traffic passing and we're kind of in the middle of the road okay so that's why it wasn't like safe to do 30 but more than 45 i know that now leaving the uh,1457.919,1496.48,809,201,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=1457,
leaving the home base yeah it's a 30 yeah yeah how would you know if it was a 20 it would be marked all over the floor but i was thinking i was thinking like what if for whatever reason eyes were they're too busy like with the smell we're saying and they couldn't and they forgot to put the lines on okay so that was the other miner that kind of bugged me then obviously the signal missing after the mini that one went down normal driving this was when we were driving and there was that bus lane on the left did i go in it no you didn't but you could have oh okay interesting so the bus lane reads monday to friday 7 to 10 a.m and 4 to 7 p.m i'm not gonna be out here doing mental mental maths on my exam well you know the time of your test is outside of those hours okay so during the test hit the bus okay okay yeah but again it's not like it was like oh you need to use the bus thing that badly,1499.12,1545.12,898,207,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=1499,
because it wasn't for very long and nobody was actually trying to get around you you're keeping up to the speed your bay park was really good it was going pear-shaped it was going very perfect it was almost gg but yeah so your right side tire was very close to the line but it was not on it wasn't over it was like i don't know when it was instead of being this it was like it was a question mark it was a question mark because it was it was a little bit but you were i thought i thought yeah i thought it was game like halfway through there but um overall really well done so it would be a pass i'm i'm happy that yeah i'm surprised i thought also i thought i failed when i am when i changed lanes on the lights with the mini no no no with the minions like right at the beginning there was it was on the 40 and i was in the right lane oh yes that lane change was a bit late but yeah overall,1546.72,1589.12,891,197,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=1546,
roundabouts lots and lots of them really well yeah you didn't reverse bay park as well but yeah just just one one one thing to mention on one of the roundabouts you know the roundabout but just before home base the big one yeah we're going left and the van was completely blocking your view and we couldn't see anything and you kind of sat i trusted that van with my with my with my heart and soul that was where you could have you easily could have just got a serious fault had there been somebody there yeah because look the way you have to think about that is you're in the left lane you intend to go in the left lane he's in the right lane he's going to go into the right hand lane in the roundabout but he's crossing the left lane and then in the right lane right so when he's taking the gap he's only considering crossing the path of whoever's in that first lane in the lane so he could be taking a bit of a risky,1590.559,1638.72,919,198,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=1590,
gap in front of the car i don't want to go forwards anymore because i was worried about being there we can't go forward beyond that point so what your next option is if he goes digitally wait yeah look for that gap for yourself because we happen to be lucky that it was clear for you and you you had a nice gap there but why why why are on the risk exactly so don't take that chance yeah okay yes i was just hoping nobody was there and then you know you got quite lucky with that and you're quite quick to get on with it as well yeah yeah don't be don't be dawdling either yeah exactly yeah had you waited it would not have gone down as a hesitation bolt because you couldn't actually see right okay well it's better to get a hesitation than like a yeah of course and plus let's say next to you instead of that little van we had a massive yeah then then then go for it okay yeah because now it's like okay well nobody,1640.559,1686.08,917,198,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=1640,
could possibly get through either way the van the van did me well pick up savann nobody likes a mini all right well that's the end of our mock test today hopefully that video has been useful for you guys as well loads and loads of roundabouts and you did really well with them just a few pointers um going forward from this but i'm not worried we're definitely going to go and try it hopefully hopefully i really hope so yeah did we do the right then not on traffic lights on this one yeah we're gonna go do it okay all right well that's the end of our mock test video today hopefully it's been useful don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe if you haven't already and follow me on my socials i will link them in the description and bye for now [Music],1687.44,1729.04,776,164,m5QIIJDg7Zk,1739,https://youtu.be/m5QIIJDg7Zk?t=1687,
okay [Music] hi guys welcome back to clearview driving so today i'm doing a mock test with felix yes today is about 12 hours up until now that we've done and he's got his test booked in a few days time and we're in a completely new area so we're in chelmsford today and that's where he managed to get his test booked now he's only had 12 hours from a complete beginner manual but the only reason he's able to get to this point up until now is because he understood the mechanics behind what was going on in the car and he's quite a quiet car enthusiast so that kind of really helped push the boat along but yeah how do you feel like you're doing so far terrible oh my god it's a big car crash no no i'm doing fine i think you're looking forward to doing the mock test now yeah with the sheet where you're gonna put all the grades i don't,11.519,78.159,837,192,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=11,
know yes i'm gonna be marking along and um i don't even know where i'm going so i'm just gonna make the route up as we go along go for a mixture of roads and see how you do all right so we're going to get started throughout the drive i want you to follow the road ahead whenever i need you to turn i will tell you if i don't say anything yeah i might ask again you can ask yeah you can definitely ask i'm gonna try and give you some signs to follow as well we're gonna do one maneuver and we may also carry out the emergency song okay okay all right before we get started i'm gonna ask you a quick question could you tell me about the general condition of your tires to be road worthy you have to take a penny and it has to be 1.6 millimeters minimum okay that sounds fine what about the actual tire itself oh it has to have no nicks no like bits coming out of it no slashes nothing,79.759,124.079,882,197,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=79,

we're currently driving on a one-way road at the end of this road we're going to be turning right so you should position your vehicle fully towards the right on a one-way road if you keep on the left-hand side of the road when making a right turn this will go down as a serious fault at the end of the road turn right please,205.92,231.44,324,70,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=205,

at the traffic lights turn right and then at the roundabout turn left traffic lights right oh thank you sorry [Music] yeah the roundabout comes up soon after as the two turns are quite close together it's really important when felix moves off from this position he goes in for a wide turn so he needs to go closer to the pavement on the opposite side of the road and then steer so he immediately turns into the left hand lane,274.24,305.919,425,87,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=274,
the next round about turn right third exit,350.56,352.32,42,8,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=350,
the roundabout ahead of us has part-time traffic lights so on approach to the roundabout you simply look and enter but halfway through the middle you may have to stop if the traffic lights are working felix doesn't realize this and as he goes round the roundabout he suddenly ends up breaking but as this was very brief this did not go down as a serious fault [Music] roundabouts are generally designed to keep the flow of traffic part-time signals like this are to ease congestion during rush hour felix does really well by getting up to the speed of the road and making quick progress as soon as you get to a new road always know the speed limit and then consider whether it's safe to drive up to that speed if there are various hazards consider what speed is safe according to what's happening on the road i'd like you to take the next road coming up on your left yeah it's at the roundabout left,371.919,441.919,899,184,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=371,
[Music] ahead on the left hand side there's a sign saying that there is a sharp right bend coming up now coming up to this bend you don't need to indicate as the road follows round to the right felix wasn't sure about the road signs here so we have to follow the road if you can pull over and park up on the left of my safe just on the road not on the pavement oh so just right now i'm waiting like those cars yeah just on the road [Music] on the road [Music] okay drive off when you're ready three to four times during your driving test you're going to be asked to park up on the left-hand side of the road you're never going to be expected to park on the pavement even if everyone else is parked over on the curb when they say park somewhere safe you need to make sure you park and avoid driveways so you can park up where there is a high curb next to you,459.22,554.959,857,192,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=459,
whenever the examiner does ask you to park up on the side they've already identified a few potential spaces as you can see there are various options along this road [Music] as we're going forward the road is getting busier felix has reduced his speed as he's going around these corners he's keeping a really good position so he can see further around the road ahead [Music],557.12,595.61,373,78,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=557,
and if you can pull over and park up on the left somewhere safe just like that just on the road [Music] you don't need to put hazard lights on by the way thank you driver when you're ready,619.36,640.8,188,43,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=619,
[Music] at the end of the road turn left please,657.5,664.24,47,12,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=657,
felix does have a habit of crossing his hands over the top of the steering wheel now this is not a fault as long as you don't actually lose control of the steering but it's a good idea to feed the steering through your hand so that you have full control [Music] at the end turn left and round about download [Music],689.519,721.61,315,69,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=689,
if you could pull over and park up on the left hand side just be fire before the blue car get fairly close but leave enough space to move away about a car's length in front okay that's fine there thank you thank you drive off when you're ready okay felix looks all around making sure it's safe to move off but there's a vehicle approaching in the distance as the vehicle passes he looks over his right blind spot again to make sure it's safe to move off you should always check your right blind spot as a final check felix always rides really efficiently he moves off in first gear but doesn't take any time before he works through the gears and drives in third gear for majority of the time this is the best way of driving to save on fuel,736.72,787.44,739,153,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=736,
all right when we get to the roundabout i'd like you to take the fourth exit please,806.959,811.04,83,19,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=806,
felix takes the gap on the roundabout really nicely he starts preparing his feet getting ready at the biting point before the gap appears this way he's able to move off straight away without delay [Music] he's counting the exits as he's going round as he's passing the third exit he checks his mirrors but he doesn't move all the way towards the left it's a good idea to move into the far left to make it easier to exit the roundabout he should have also checked his mirrors again in case of anybody trying to overtake him we're currently on a 70 miles per hour dual carriageway felix makes good progress and he's driving in fourth gear at the moment as we're going forward he speeds up and switches straight into gear six you can opt for a block gear change as long as you're fast enough to go into the next gear block gear changes save fuel felix is very confident driving up to,828.56,888.959,880,188,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=828,
this speed as we're going forward the vehicle ahead of us was driving a bit slow so he decided to start overtaking once you've overtaken it's important you move back into the left hand lane which felix does really well you only really need to overtake someone if they're driving 10 or more under the speed limit and only when it's safe and necessary when it's safe to do so i'd like you to demonstrate how you would miss the rear windscreen oh do you missed it that one thank you it off we're going to be going up to the next round about it's going to be a double roundabout we're going right in the second one so ahead of the first one right right at the second one they're very close together we're going towards the a12 okay approaching this big roundabout we're going straight ahead on the first and then turning right third exit so in order to turn right you need to start off in the right hand lane felix moves,890.639,967.12,916,198,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=890,
into the left hand lane before we entered,969.12,970.639,41,8,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=969,
um you are allowed to switch lanes on a roundabout provided it is safe to do so,992.639,998.399,79,18,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=992,
so i'm taking it yeah felix joins the slip road really confidently by getting up to the speed of the road and using his right hand mirror by leaning forward so that he can see over into his blind spot without having to turn around always be sure to use the third length of the slip road and adjust your speed if necessary,1019.279,1054.72,321,65,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=1019,
when traveling on a dual carriageway like this you're going to get a countdown marker along the left hand side of the road you're going to get a marker at 300 200 and then 100 yards always try to indicate at least two to three hundred yards before your exit the faster you're driving the earlier you should signal so felix gets marked down for approach speed leading up to this next roundabout as we've just been driving on a 70 miles per hour road for quite some time he doesn't realize how fast he's driving so always watch your speed to realize what speed you're actually driving as it may feel like you're slow but you're actually quite fast [Music] okay let the next round about turn right again yeah right that exit again [Music] that's one sorry second exit this one here as felix comes off the roundabout he goes into the overtaking lane on the exit again this is not a major fault as,1074.64,1171.039,892,193,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=1074,
long as you don't carry on driving in this lane and other cars are having to go around you towards the left to overtake you as long as you move back into the left-hand lane this is not a fault as we enter this roundabout felix gets marked down for use of mirrors change direction as he doesn't maintain his position in his lane he needed to go further round the roundabout he straight lines the roundabout if another vehicle had been alongside us this would have been a serious fault,1173.6,1211.28,483,99,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=1173,
no sorry about that okay so now i need to go ahead left at this round [Music] hey traffic lights turn left,1227.52,1265.2,106,24,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=1227,
[Music] take the next road on your left if you could pull over and pop on the right hand side of the road just on this yellow line if you would like your reverse back for about two car lengths keeping a reasonable distance from the pavement as you hurry up the exercise and try not to touch the girl before starting to reverse always look around over both blind spots and make sure you're not reversing if anybody is passing your vehicle felix gets marked down serious as he does not check his blind spots and does not stop for the lorry that's passing him is that okay two colleagues no keep reversing thank you drive up when you're ready,1283.74,1375.84,639,128,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=1283,
just turn left into the where am i center we're just gonna go forward and if you just forward park into any of those spaces so just go forward to the left here and just drive forward into any it doesn't need to be perfect just go slowly though that we find there thank you secure the car secure the car please and switch off the engine all right that's the end of your test now how was the drive for you okay yeah not too bad um i felt i felt like i missed one roundabout but apart from that i think it went okay yeah now unfortunately that wouldn't be a pass okay okay and there's it's right at the end is it because of that roundabout how i the roundabout because it happened to be clear it wasn't a big issue but it was very much cutting into one it's just like oh you're straight lining it yeah yeah no i know i saw and also another thing you're doing on roundabouts is as you're entering to go,1392.4,1466.64,898,196,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=1392,
ahead you keep signaling right okay why are we signaling right if you're going straight oh so oh right then makes sense yeah yeah so taking the second exit 12 o'clock you've gone in and then you're signaling right you did that twice um no but unfortunately it wouldn't be a fair it wouldn't be a pass so i'm quite shocked at what just happened within the last 30 seconds okay why so that reverse thing on the right what happened there i said reverse back for two collins would you say you reversed back for two collins yeah where were you looking while reversing i was looking on my side mirror in that mirror okay where do you look while reversing also then there did you check there and there no now why do you think i said to you reverse again so you would see if i would do the checks and there's a big lorry passing you kind of carried on i kind of just looked at you like this,1468.48,1528.799,882,186,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=1468,
by the end i'm like is this boy serious okay okay so let's talk about some of the other pointers um going a little bit too fast on um some of the roads like just because it says 70 or 60 doesn't mean you need to hit it you need to drive at that speed only if it's safe it is quite challenging around here isn't it yeah oh yeah much more than in london so sometimes we need those hazards to just uh slow things down a little bit um there's so much happen though just okay right at the beginning i asked you to park up on the left yeah okay someone's safe and you wanted to park on the pavement that's what i thought we're gonna park on the road now i just need to make sure there's no driveway here when you're stopping right yeah that's what i meant by that so you kind of just started breaking stopping there was a lady behind you and now by the time you're stopping she was not right close behind you you started,1530.08,1580.08,914,200,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=1530,
slowing down stopping and then as soon as you stopped you put your hazards on um it wasn't clear that you're stopping so you need to let her know okay put your indicator on okay okay yeah your approach speed to some junctions like you know when you're coming up to a roundabout yeah i was coming in too fast you're coming in a bit fast and i know you're kind of controlling it there at the end what if there was a car suddenly there yeah all right so what do we need to work on going forward so the speed again yes looking when i uh over my shoulders my blind spots and i know the camera's there mirrors are there but that's not enough why do we actually need to check these lines what's going on because there could be a cyclist and we can't pick them up with the the side mirrors nor the reversing camera that's it um what else uh you're approaching now we've talked about speed quite a few times just when,1582.72,1631.679,908,194,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=1582,
you asked me to park i'm so lost because i don't know what you mean by park because for me this is a road we can't park on yeah and then you're like well we have to park up yeah so okay now i know what you mean but before i was okay where did i park yeah so when everyone else is parked up on those roads you just got to make sure that you park up on the side on the road but out of the way and not on the pavement not on the pavement no you're never going to be expected to park on the pavement in a driving test okay not unless the examiner states i would like you to park up on the pavement go half on the pavement they will say that specifically but if you don't have that you're going on the road never go on the pavement okay i can't believe that reverse honestly but besides that i didn't like the approach speed to the junction it just felt too quick but you're really getting up to 70,1633.84,1676.399,893,198,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=1633,
really going up to high gears which is great to see slip roads keeping up with the speed of the road handling the steering at those big roads and stuff yeah it was very nice use of mirrors and roundabouts all of that stuff was really good but just don't get to that round about too quickly yeah okay yeah oh yeah you're one of the other faults i forgot at the beginning right at the beginning you know when we did that right turn the roundabouts around here they're kind of part traffic light part give way and sometimes the traffic lights come in and off i i broke and then i realized the traffic lights aren't working so i need to keep going yeah so the traffic lights only come in sometimes yeah and obviously they're out so i mean it's just a normal giveaway round about at the time okay okay well that's the end of our mock test today we'll let you know how the test goes so we have a few days to brush up on everything i'm not overly concerned because everything i've,1678.159,1725.84,973,201,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=1678,
mentioned on here he knows already it's not new information for him he knows i'm always telling him off for going too fast approaching a roundabout um so yeah we've got time to fix this but yeah thank you for watching hopefully the video has been useful for you guys as well don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe if you haven't already i've linked my socials in the description so be sure to follow bye for now [Music],1727.279,1755.44,444,93,dCmbR51A3eU,1756,https://youtu.be/dCmbR51A3eU?t=1727,
[Music] hi guys welcome back to clearview driving my name is amman and today i'm doing a mock test with sarajen now this is the first time we're driving together but you have done a mock test before yeah so you know what's involved and your test is in you said two weeks time now his test isn't yeting and that's exactly where we are so you get to practice the roads that you're already familiar with and we've had a bit of a drive so you're familiar with the car all right so do you want me to tell you a little bit about what's going to happen in the tests yeah okay so throughout the drive i want you to follow the road ahead i'm going to tell you in plenty of time whenever i need you to turn i'm going to get you to follow some road signs for a little while which will be your independent driving i'm going to get you to carry,16.16,66.24,831,187,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=16,
out one maneuver and we may also do the emergency stop okay now before we get started i'm going to ask you a quick question could you tell me where would you find the coolant and how do you check it at the right level um the coolant's in the engine b and there's a minimum and maximum okay gauge on it so it has to be between those okay perfect that's fine now for any of you that are looking for driving insurance i'm going to put a link in the description for temporary cover whether it's to be driving with your parents or if you want to insure your vehicle for your driving test day you can use this link now before we get into it don't forget to like comment and subscribe already already subscribe okay so we're gonna get started now whenever you're ready suru all right drive off whenever you're ready okay [Music],67.84,123.44,821,171,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=67,
now when we get to the end of this road term right [Music],143.2,149.41,58,15,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=143,
as we got to the end of this road to turn right there was a vehicle on the left hand side who was sort of turning around this is why surgeon decided to wait this wouldn't really be an issue as we had just started the test at this point so up at the end here we're going to turn the left and then at the roundabout take the third exit right the roundabout is immediately after the left-hand turn so it's a good idea to position towards the right as you come up to this first junction in order to move into the right hand lane at the roundabout sergeant positions in the left hand lane now from this position if you know the area you know you can use the left lane to make a right turn but it's always safer to be in the right hand lane to make the right turn for the vehicles on the roundabout as we're joining onto a dual carriageway the middle lane ends up going all the way around the roundabout and becoming,165.76,226.159,910,196,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=165,
the left hand lane on the carriageway but it's a good idea to be on the right where the red fan is as it's a safer position to turn from surgeon should also be signaling right from this point at the beginning he's not signaling but he does signal once he reaches the first island so this is why he doesn't get marked down for this,227.68,247.519,330,73,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=227,
[Music] the signal here is crucial if he did not signal right and went all the way around the roundabout from this lane this would have been a serious fault as the vehicles waiting at exit number two may not realize he's coming round the roundabout from this position which is why it would have been better to start in the far right lane okay we're going to start the independent driving from here i'd like you to follow signs towards rice lip approaching this next roundabout rice lip is the second exit which is sign posted around 10 o'clock as we go forward our lane divides into two you can use either the far left or the middle lane to go to right slip surgeon goes into the middle lane which puts him into the overtaking lane on the roundabout [Music],277.02,326.08,757,156,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=277,
starting the roundabout in the overtaking lane is not a concern surgeon does this roundabout really well as soon as he enters he's checking his mirror towards the left to follow his lane he follows the lane round after first exit he signals left to exit and stays in the overtaking lane and even checks his mirrors as he's merging off the roundabout [Music],359.36,387.15,357,73,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=359,
now there's two signs to rise like we're following ahead,430.72,432.319,56,12,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=430,
[Music] so surgeon does this roundabout really well on the exit the two lanes are merging you would simply need to just check your mirrors and merge and turn surgeon does look over his shoulder to check his blind spot but this is not necessary as the lane on the right is fully covered in the mirror and you don't need to look over your shoulder [Music] so we're following signs to southwest it now,448.08,491.52,398,82,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=448,
whenever you're approaching traffic lights that have been green for some time always step off the accelerator if you have time to stop you can stop in this case we didn't have time sergeant did step off the accelerator but it would not have been safe to stop at those traffic lights that would be the end of your independent driving from here i'm going to give you normal directions from now on if you can pull over and park up on the left somewhere safe thank you i'm trying to be ready,541.6,575.519,487,98,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=541,
[Music] when going around a park vehicle always aim to leave at least one meter of clearance if the space is smaller than that then you need to go slower through that space and the traffic lights turn left,596.59,616.16,205,41,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=596,
as we go forward to turn left just after the stop line there is a giveaway line on the floor this is in case the traffic lights were not working or if you were in heavy traffic you just need to look across to the right as you go forward checking over your shoulders to move your position like this is not necessary as we just need to see the space to the right so mirrors should be sufficient for this traffic lights turn left [Music],634.48,670.75,434,88,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=634,
at the roundabout timer [Music],695.92,699.94,31,8,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=695,
and then turn right at the very end okay so what i'd like you to do now is to reverse back into a space of your choice you can just reverse into any one of those if you like you'll hear but it's people too,727.92,746.959,205,48,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=727,
so before starting to reverse in a car park always look all around looking over your shoulders quite thoroughly as it's quite easy to miss pedestrians or anybody that may be walking along with a trolley as sergeant going back into the space he's currently reversing into the middle of two spaces but there's a trolley parked in the bay on the right so he needs to go forward to adjust his maneuver,794.24,826.88,397,78,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=794,
you can readjust this one,855.519,855.519,25,6,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=855,
[Music] as he did have to go forward to readjust his maneuver this will give him a minor fault for this control we are parked in the space by the end he's slightly closer to the line on the right but we are in the space but i just had to open the door to check this if the examiner is not sure whether you're fully in the space they'll get you to secure the car and then open the door or even step outside before they get you to go again thank you just to kill the club all right thank you traveling we're just going to exit the car walk now,875.85,925.36,541,120,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=875,
when moving off from this part position it's a good idea to use your indicators to alert others you're about to move off,949.6,953.279,120,25,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=949,
and left again at these traffic lights this is a good example of when you may need to use the horn to alert others of your presence as the traffic lights have been green for some time and the vehicle ahead has not reacted to them [Music],972.48,1005.03,237,49,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=972,
as you can see there's loads more vehicles ahead and the road is getting tighter so sarijin notices this and goes back into second gear for better control the smaller the gap the slower you should go [Music],1032.079,1049.88,207,43,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=1032,
if you can pull over and park up on the left somewhere safe thank you tribal gonna be ready,1073.6,1089.28,91,19,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=1073,
[Music] following the road ahead second exit [Music],1112.26,1131.65,52,12,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=1112,
that's around about 10 yeah [Music],1165.12,1167.68,35,10,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=1165,
the end of the road term right [Music],1203.2,1206.31,38,10,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=1203,
surgeon deals with the width restriction really nicely by positioning early and continuing at a slow speed turn left from it,1229.919,1240.0,124,23,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=1229,
ahead of us there's a level crossing but this time it's for an airport runway so when the lights start flashing you'd be required to stop before the solid line that's painted across the floor [Music],1261.36,1273.55,199,42,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=1261,
so [Music] whenever your view of the zebra crossing is obstructed by any vehicles always slow down to look behind in case there's someone already in the road at the roundabout follow the road ahead this is the second exit [Music] generally on approach to roundabouts when you're following the road ahead you can use the left hand lane if the left hand lane is going left only you're going to get road markings well in advance [Music] so [Music],1298.0,1359.37,444,95,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=1298,
whilst operating the ancillary controls it's really important to keep good progress and good control of the steering okay when it's safe to do so i'd like you to demonstrate how you would de-miss the rear windscreen as surgeon starts looking for the rear demister he does slow down while doing this giving him a minor fault for progress,1379.44,1394.96,336,68,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=1379,
next roundabout i'd like you to take the full things in towards heading,1413.52,1415.36,71,15,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=1413,
approaching this round about to take the full exit we do need to start on the far right lane approaching these traffic lights surgeons should have stepped off the accelerator on approach but it wasn't safe to stop by the time that they were changing as we go around the lane starts to split into two halves and we need to be on the first half in order to take the fourth exit as the right lane is now a new lane to go back to right slip as we're leaving the roundabout from this lane surgeon does make a serious fault with the use of mirrors change direction our lane is partially blocked by the bus ahead who needs to go around to right slip surgeon should have either waited in this position or moved over nice and early the point he's trying to move over there was already a vehicle on his left and he causes them to slow down [Music] changing lanes on a roundabout like this may get you in a bit of trouble so it's better to just stay in that lane and,1432.64,1510.96,955,197,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=1432,
wait until your lane clears up and exit the roundabout more easily you can switch but if you're not sure it's better to keep waiting at the roundabout i'd like you to follow the road ahead it's the second exit leading up to this roundabout you can see the first and the third exit have quite a thick broad line whereas the second exit has a very thin line which means it's not a main exit we should have used the left lane and then into the middle lane to follow the road ahead our lane does have a straight arrow but that does not mean that it does go straight this lane is just for going right third exit on the roundabout and it's the overtaking lane on the exit so the middle lane is also able to turn right on this roundabout which is why it would have been better to start in the middle lane to follow the road ahead the traffic on the roundabout is currently quite heavy we're crossing three lanes of traffic so if you can see,1513.279,1568.799,933,197,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=1513,
that there are no gaps to get going you should wait with the clutch down fully and the brake on surgeon is currently waiting with the clutch half up and the brake on which is why the engine sounds so loud it's not a good idea waiting at this point as this does wear down the clutch plates over time you should only prepare your feet ready to go when you notice a gap is approaching as it doesn't take very long to go from the bottom of the clutch to the biting point surgeon gets another serious fault for use of mirrors change direction at this point as the blue car enters a roundabout as we're about to exit and they entered with no signal which means they're going straight ahead they happened to make a left turn but it wasn't safe with the way we exit the roundabout this is why it's really important to be in the left-hand lane when your exit is coming up so you can exit more easily if the blue car had been going straight,1570.96,1632.4,930,191,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=1570,
this would have been a dangerous fault where i would have had to take control [Music],1634.0,1640.45,85,18,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=1634,
and then if you can park up on the left hand side just over there yeah just just up there that'd be great just keep going all the way forward not too not too close that'd be great thank you secure the car and you can switch off the engine as well all right give me a few minutes all right that brings us to the end of your test how was your drive it was all right but i think there may have been one or two things okay what's that um the bay parking was one and also when we just came off that heading exit um there was a car that pulled right across because i didn't see it and then you came in yeah you really cut it fine on that one it kind of put you in a bit of danger there didn't it because you're switching over and then we've got a bus in front as well now had you switched over earlier it would have been fine yeah or just stayed in that lane kind of just stuck behind,1664.559,1721.039,878,193,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=1664,
the bus it's fine yeah but yeah unfortunately it would be a fail on this occasion mainly that was your first fall that was your first series that getting round about but then afterwards this roundabout why did you use the right lane to go straight i was thinking because if we're going to come around yeah but we'll deal with that later to come off the roundabout you needed to be in the other lane it's so funny because i had a sneaky suspicion in my head i was like he knows he's going to go towards the test center he's going to start in the right lane do not do that because you were in the roundabout in the inside lane right yeah and your lane's supposed to go round i know you checked and signal there was a blue car that entered from exit 1 and they entered as soon as you've gone past them they come in they happen to make a left turn yeah but they could have gone round in that first lane towards hillingdon that,1723.039,1772.64,922,197,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=1723,
way yeah so you've really put yourself in danger on that and on both occasions it's the same fault use of mirrors change directions now on both occasions you are checking your mirrors so it's not that you're not checking but you're not actually reacting to what you see that's really the issue okay i would rather you went right at the end there than trying to come off on this exit okay besides that um there really isn't a lot going on i had a few faults besides that i've got but for me i'm going to give you a few pointers firstly that bay park there was a trolley right behind you and you went bang in the middle of the two spaces yeah so you know when you have the option and the examiner says park somewhere yeah i should have chosen chosen choose a more appropriate spot i completely missed that one actually i didn't see that so when you look back i thought there's a trolley what's he gonna do yeah but yeah once you'd started you,1774.48,1826.88,940,197,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=1774,
couldn't then go around and start somewhere else you have to kind of do it here now yeah and you managed to save it really nicely looking around so you get marked down for control but nothing more than that um now on this roundabout we waited there for quite some time didn't we okay you didn't miss any gaps but as you're waiting did you hear the car was quite loud because i was holding it on the right yeah that's a bad habit you could see that none of those gaps were feasible you could not take it so what's the point of a seeing on the buying point where the car is kind of rearing to go and you're restricting it with the brake so in terms of a driving test that's not something the examiner is going to go oh that's bad because for them they don't care how you drive it's about the safety so that's going to result in you having to get your clutch changed over time yeah so that's something just i would,1829.12,1876.08,911,196,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=1829,
have personally just waited with the clutch down fully you can see none of those gaps you could have taken and how long does it really take to go from the bottom to the biting point not even a second yeah you kind of you're familiar with the cast right away actually you were driving really well with clearance all round really nice you didn't really have any time any issues with the clutch no stalling nothing like that yeah you check this left mirror like a lot a lot i block yeah yeah i know my instructor said that i should be checking that one more but i always tend to look that way for some reason you want to check what's behind you so this one every eight to ten seconds i feel like you were checking that one every five seconds there was one point i'm thinking what's he doing i'm just smiling to myself it was like how many times is he checking on the left and it was so nice and clear there was nothing going on so yeah it's not like like like i said,1877.84,1923.919,963,199,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=1877,
it's not an issue it's just like what are you doing just checking front and right oh yeah one big one from the beginning you know what we went up to this round about the very beginning yeah you know when you you knew you were gonna go right third exit right yeah but you use the left lane to go the middle yeah i was yeah i'm not too sure i was thinking because it goes all the way around all the way around now you can technically the road marking does allow it now thankfully you did signal once you went in but i personally would advise against that because you're going all the way around the outskirts the cars that are waiting ahead of you at yeting yeah they don't realize i know you're signaling but they really don't notice that you're going to be going all the way around and turning it would have been better for you to start in the right and then just come left and then move over yeah you know you're going right why not position on the right,1925.679,1973.2,955,198,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=1925,
yeah i was just thinking also because obviously to finish in that left leg yeah but it's not about having it's not about all i need to be on the left it's about doing that roundabout safely in you know so we'll practice this round about a little bit because i feel like this one if you were a little bit more confident on it yeah that'll be a good start because this is the first round about you're gonna be on and last one at the end and that's where we did have our serious fault you know when you exit yeah um yeah so how was this mock test experience for you it was i think it was good because based on my last mock test as well um they weren't majors based on like maybe junctions or poor control but like that one where i like rushed out and the lane choices so they're like smaller things that were also in the last mock test as well so it's more or less the thing that you're yeah that's it it just needs to,1974.72,2022.799,915,200,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=1974,
be neatened up a little bit there really wasn't much going on so overall you are a very good driver but you just need to be safer when you exit roundabouts because on both occasions that's what it was yeah even if you had stayed on the right and that would have been carried on that would have been okay okay all right well that's the end of our mock test video today hopefully this video has been useful for you guys as well it's a shame about those faults but um yeah you haven't gone long to go in terms of uh getting this done yeah you are a very good driver so you can nice and easy kind of tighten this up but um thank you for watching don't forget to like comment and subscribe [Music],2024.32,2059.08,692,148,woVflyNlrKk,2061,https://youtu.be/woVflyNlrKk?t=2024,

thank you drive off when you're ready when moving off from this park position millie should have taken a little bit of care as we're really close to the car in front she needed to use tighter clutch control and more steering to get herself out of this position more easily she gets an advisory fault for this as there was nobody to the right and she was able to swing over [Music] at the end of the road turn left [Music],185.28,222.3,421,89,DeQVsoP3RII,1778,https://youtu.be/DeQVsoP3RII?t=185,
okay we're going to start the independent driving now i want you to follow some signs towards ricelin the independent driver roughly lasts 15 to 20 minutes so when you're following road signs be sure to look out for any signs on the road as we're going forward on the roundabout right step is sign posted straight ahead at 12 o'clock just after this sign there's another sign which reads that you have to be in the right hand lane to follow the road ahead if there are no signs that means you need to keep following the road ahead [Music],246.64,282.46,538,113,DeQVsoP3RII,1778,https://youtu.be/DeQVsoP3RII?t=246,
during your driving test you're going to be asked to pull over and park along the left three to four times now when the examiner says pull over and park they've already identified a few spaces they'll usually say pull over and park on the left somewhere safe well if there's driveways are out they'll say don't worry about the driveways on this occasion if there's a single yellow line you can park along this if they say don't worry about the yellow line on this occasion but if you have the option to avoid a yellow line and to avoid any driveways then that's where you should park along this road i asked millie to pull over and park up on the left somewhere safe you want to make sure you don't park close to any junctions or next to any islands where you would block up the road otherwise you can park anywhere along this main road all right emily i'd like you to pull over and park up on the left somewhere safe along this road,328.08,374.16,933,196,DeQVsoP3RII,1778,https://youtu.be/DeQVsoP3RII?t=328,
anywhere along here it's fine okay yeah okay sorry [Music] yeah anywhere safe along this road is fine when parking up on a road like this you want to make sure you're not parking close to any bus stops or any islands you want to make sure you're parked up somewhere where it's nice and easy for vehicles around you to be able to get through so not close to any junctions either just something straight just right okay drive up when you're ready,380.0,439.12,444,93,DeQVsoP3RII,1778,https://youtu.be/DeQVsoP3RII?t=380,
i'd like you to now follow signs towards the edding from here as we go forward from this point yeting is the second exit sign posted at 10 o'clock it's quite a thin line which means it's not a main road now as we're going forward the left lane splits into two with the left half having a left only arrow now you can't see the road marking until quite late now in terms of the road marking on the roundabout the left lane does go second exit towards yeti so this does not go down as a serious fault but normally you'd be positioned in the middle lane to go to yeting,458.96,490.24,565,126,DeQVsoP3RII,1778,https://youtu.be/DeQVsoP3RII?t=458,
the traffic around us is currently covering the road marking but if we see where the learner car is and go forward from this position the lane does allow us to go into the left-hand lane in the roundabout so as the road markings does allow this this does not go down as a serious fault,506.8,521.599,285,58,DeQVsoP3RII,1778,https://youtu.be/DeQVsoP3RII?t=506,
[Music] millie does check her mirrors but she checks quite late but this does not go down as a fault as we're already in the left-hand lane and the left-hand lane gets priority on the exit which is why it's always safer to exit a roundabout in the left-hand lane [Music] just ahead of us there is a bus lane starting now we're outside of the bus lane operation hours so millie should have used the bus lane as it's now the position for normal driving she goes into the right hand lane which is now the overtaking lane so always use the bus lane if we're outside of the hours that are listed on the signboard [Music],539.15,586.46,615,137,DeQVsoP3RII,1778,https://youtu.be/DeQVsoP3RII?t=539,
okay that'll be the end of your independent driving i'm gonna give you directions just normal from now if you can take the next road on your right it's just after the red car,613.36,620.72,174,37,DeQVsoP3RII,1778,https://youtu.be/DeQVsoP3RII?t=613,
okay if you can pull in and park up on the left [Music] all right what i'd like you to do now using the vehicle in front i'd like you to carry out the parallel park exercise this one just hit yeah so starting next to that blue car in the road then reverse back and finish within two collins think of that driveway as a high curb okay so don't go in that section okay but you can park in front of it it's not a problem,661.04,695.04,417,95,DeQVsoP3RII,1778,https://youtu.be/DeQVsoP3RII?t=661,

we're going ahead at the traffic lights [Music] milly forgets to change gears when we stop at the traffic lights she starts moving off but stores the engine she reacts very quickly so this does not go down as a serious fault sorry [Music],915.36,948.08,238,51,DeQVsoP3RII,1778,https://youtu.be/DeQVsoP3RII?t=915,

when we get to the next round about i'd like you to take the fourth exit right when driving on a dual carriageway like this make sure to switch lanes early when you can see the road signs for the roundabout approaching,1035.28,1053.36,218,47,DeQVsoP3RII,1778,https://youtu.be/DeQVsoP3RII?t=1035,
[Music] as we're taking the fourth exit right we need to go into the lane that's closest to the roundabout once in position checking mirrors towards the left and spiraling with the white line to the left milly does this really well [Music] sorry if i just come we're currently standing next to exit number three exit four is directly ahead we could have been in the left lane but we're in the overtaking lane that does take the exit [Music] as we're coming off the roundabout millie does go slightly over the speed limit as she's checking her mirrors and trying to merge on the left she does control the speed fairly quickly so this does not go down as a serious fault,1073.12,1142.96,668,142,DeQVsoP3RII,1778,https://youtu.be/DeQVsoP3RII?t=1073,

whenever the road opens up and splits into two lanes if both lanes are going straight ahead you should always go into the left one as that's the position for normal driving milly goes into the overtaking lane but this wasn't an issue as this wasn't for very long and nobody went out of their way to overtake us,1213.679,1227.36,310,66,DeQVsoP3RII,1778,https://youtu.be/DeQVsoP3RII?t=1213,

if you can pull in and park up on that just after this black card don't worry about the drives on this one that'll be fine there thank you all right what we're going to do now is shortly i'm going to get you to carry out the emergency stop so as we're driving down this road i'm going to have a good look around like this and then i'm going to give you this signal stop as soon as you get that signal i need you to stop the car as quickly and as safely as possible imagine a child has just come running out in front of you when that happens okay so whenever you're ready move off,1343.039,1378.799,579,128,DeQVsoP3RII,1778,https://youtu.be/DeQVsoP3RII?t=1343,
so wait for my signal okay [Music] stop that thank you drive up when you're ready i'm not gonna get you to do that again [Music] if you can pull it and park up on the left just after this speed bump i just kind of where the speed bump is right here parking right right literally that's fine thank you fine okay okay secure the call okay you just give me a few minutes all right that's the end of your driving test how was the drive today um i noticed just like a few things was that's fine so would you say there are any serious faults today um i didn't think there were any serious but i thought there were a few miners okay i want to talk about the main one you know as we're driving along on that road i said to you pull over and park on that road yeah why didn't you want to park on that road i didn't realize you could i don't know so were there any markings,1395.36,1491.6,863,192,DeQVsoP3RII,1778,https://youtu.be/DeQVsoP3RII?t=1395,
like double yellow lines red lines anything like that telling you you can't park there so i know yeah so on that road i asked you to park up and we had lots of spaces so it's a nice open road there's hatch markings in the middle there are no markings you just need to make sure when you stop you don't stop next to an island yeah or in front of a junction or on the bus stop or these zigzag lines and there's a few obstructions but you need to kind of just go in between them there's lots of space so that's why i said it a few times i think yeah we can park up here okay by the time you parked up there was that island on the right that was kind of very close to you okay yeah and then because your attention's on parking and the roads started to curve at this one remember and had to grab the wheel we would have hit that left tire the front one so you've got a steering series on that one okay and then again,1493.679,1536.24,911,201,DeQVsoP3RII,1778,https://youtu.be/DeQVsoP3RII?t=1493,
the position we stopped at did you hear a hoot from one of the vans that passed yeah yeah that's because of where we stopped was that the second time no the first time first time okay so i asked you to park up again the second time it was much better yeah okay so the road that we're on i know you probably thought oh my god it's a big road why am i parking here but there are no no markings telling you you can't be there okay yeah i thought that might catch you out a little bit yeah we talked about that road previously that you can park here besides that i want to tell you about your reverse park beautiful really nicely done really good control great observation um your clutch control when coming out of junctions really really nice especially the ones where there's parked cars obstructing your view you're coming out ever so carefully and looking can't fault you on that at all okay we did have the one stall i know you were covered,1538.4,1585.279,941,192,DeQVsoP3RII,1778,https://youtu.be/DeQVsoP3RII?t=1538,
yeah i was like i can't so you checked checked your mirrors before moving off that was great as well um went over speed a little bit as we come off of the round about the second time you controlled it yeah straight away which is good really good use of mirrors overall because i was worried where did we come off it must have been white heart yeah it was where the you know how they merged together yeah and there was cars there that's when i was literally staring at that mirror there was a learner car there yeah you were checking you dealt with that nicely yeah um yeah they were quite far back because you were quick to make progress that's why we had the advantage of being ahead of this you didn't want to park on that road that was the main issue yeah do you get why it was safe now no i do i do get i don't know i think i know now so i'll just so you just need to make sure you don't park on the bus stop on the zigzags,1586.4,1631.44,927,200,DeQVsoP3RII,1778,https://youtu.be/DeQVsoP3RII?t=1586,
or next to an island because then we're obstructing the road we shouldn't be there yeah um a few times we could have been in well we could have been in the bus lane yeah i was i was thinking about that but then i don't know i was just like yeah it wasn't for too long that's why nobody even went around us so it's not a big deal happened it was all all accumulated in that same little challenge oh i did which was really done yeah i was indicating left when we were going right around the thing at which one like that small round about before what's it called it's like that mini one but it's got grass in the middle this first one you didn't indicate you indicated left as you come off oh wait i know which one oh i know which one you're on about you're on about right at the end yes that was a signal um you didn't you didn't you forgot to put your i knew i was going i just like yeah you had a,1633.52,1683.44,896,201,DeQVsoP3RII,1778,https://youtu.be/DeQVsoP3RII?t=1633,
right signal one at the beginning you did yeah and you went around and you just come off with the right signal oh okay fine that's all it was and you forgot to turn your signal the other way okay emergency stop i know you thought it wasn't the best yeah but it was what it was it was an emergency stop you did stop we probably could stop a bit quicker okay so all you need to do there is just break a bit further yeah no i knew i could have done it it wasn't like really bad where i'm like oh that's not great would it like that would be sufficient yeah okay yeah worst case scenario if they feel like all you know she could have done that a bit better they'll just be like all right i'll get you to do that again if it's like borderline if it's too slow then it's just like okay well that's not good enough so just for me it could have just been a bit far large yeah yeah so we just could have break a bit more,1685.52,1730.0,911,201,DeQVsoP3RII,1778,https://youtu.be/DeQVsoP3RII?t=1685,
differently but that break on there yeah okay okay so overall not bad result there aren't a lot of miners going on uh it was where i asked you to park up and then obviously the the road marking on that one yeah with the road marking one i feel like i can't exactly fault you because of the way the road follows i just i don't know i genuinely thought i could do that i don't know why it's something i will kind of speak to them about that yeah so for me as well generally don't worry cool all right well that's the end of our mock test video today hopefully you can learn from millie's mistakes and hopefully i'll pass on the next one definitely definitely that's the aim but yeah um yeah bye for now [Music],1731.12,1777.14,708,155,DeQVsoP3RII,1778,https://youtu.be/DeQVsoP3RII?t=1731,

take last month test yeah all right hi guys oh good i was gonna say hi guys good morning hi guys welcome back to another mock test now today it's the day before the actual test well this is our last lesson so this is your last official mock test how are you feeling okay do you feel like you can you can do it on your own do you feel like you'll be ready i feel like i can i'm just gonna get used to the sat there and i think i'll be all right okay so whenever you're ready you know the drill i'm gonna get you to start the engine,27.92,64.0,530,119,fdausOL9QOM,1716,https://youtu.be/fdausOL9QOM?t=27,
i'm just going to get the ac to it's like so hot right now it should start i'll fill up your second thing we're getting somewhere okay so whenever you're ready,79.439,91.439,159,36,fdausOL9QOM,1716,https://youtu.be/fdausOL9QOM?t=79,
so we're going to be turning left from here i don't think the sat nav volume's on so i'll adjust that in a second turn left good song yeah it's quite late it'll be fine after this [Music] at the end of the road turn left b455 when following instructions on a sat nav you're going to get an audible warning two to three hundred yards before the junction and then again closer to the turn if you're traveling at higher speeds you'll get this warning slightly earlier but always look at the very top of the sat nav to see which direction you're going and how far the turn is turn left when you're waiting at the end of a road and you're already at the giveaway line and somebody on the right is blocking your view it's not safe to edge forward so continue waiting or you can look through their windows and see if it's clear but if you can't see you need to keep waiting until the road clears up,107.92,174.64,891,192,fdausOL9QOM,1716,https://youtu.be/fdausOL9QOM?t=107,
this would not be counted as a hesitation fault,176.8,178.159,47,9,fdausOL9QOM,1716,https://youtu.be/fdausOL9QOM?t=176,
after 300 yards cross the roundabout and take the second exit b455 cross the roundabout and take the second exit,193.44,203.76,112,24,fdausOL9QOM,1716,https://youtu.be/fdausOL9QOM?t=193,
as we went forward from this point the bus driver in front switches on their right signal to move away millie didn't realize this she starts overtaking with a right signal she does realise very quickly and starts giving way so this did not go down as a serious fault but always make sure to check the bus stop and see if the bus is about to move off [Music] millie does deal with the situation really well by checking her mirrors and getting back into position if you're driving up behind a bus at high speeds and you start positioning and signaling to overtake even if the bus driver changes their signal sometimes it's safer to continue but in this case because we were quite slow it was safer to give way if you can pull in and park up on the left anywhere safe along this road,237.76,299.04,780,158,fdausOL9QOM,1716,https://youtu.be/fdausOL9QOM?t=237,
thank you travis when you're ready [Music],318.56,327.17,42,11,fdausOL9QOM,1716,https://youtu.be/fdausOL9QOM?t=318,
this zebra crossing is a double crossing with the island dividing the two sides as long as the pedestrians are in the middle we can continue safely [Music] leading up to this roundabout right slip is sign posted in the right hand lane with a straight arrow and the road markings so millie checks her mirrors signals right and moves into the right hand lane in good time cross the roundabout and take the third exit a4180 b455,345.28,382.319,425,87,fdausOL9QOM,1716,https://youtu.be/fdausOL9QOM?t=345,
as we moved off at this point millie does slightly encroach into the left-hand lane but nobody was affected by this so this does go down as a fault but always make sure to check your mirrors in case somebody from the left is straight lining the roundabout,397.36,408.4,255,52,fdausOL9QOM,1716,https://youtu.be/fdausOL9QOM?t=397,
our exit is straight ahead of us but we are in the overtaking lane on the exit now we could switch into the left hand lane if it's clear or you can simply stay in this lane use your mirrors and exit when this lane clears up take the exit a4180 b455,429.28,443.72,248,57,fdausOL9QOM,1716,https://youtu.be/fdausOL9QOM?t=429,

after 400 yards go right on the roundabout and take the third exit a40 traveling at 40 miles per hour always aim to slow down and approach the roundabout in second gear so that you have enough time to assess the roundabout millie ends up slowing down and changing gears quite late that she doesn't realize that she's still in second gear as she's waiting,500.319,519.599,354,75,fdausOL9QOM,1716,https://youtu.be/fdausOL9QOM?t=500,
sorry once we're in the roundabout millie starts signaling left when second exit hasn't passed this could have been a serious fault had somebody waiting at exit 2 started entering before us [Music] take the exit a40 it's really important to wait until you pass the second exit before you start signaling as it may be confusing for the traffic head-on,540.399,570.72,350,71,fdausOL9QOM,1716,https://youtu.be/fdausOL9QOM?t=540,
after 800 yards the satnav says keep right it's because we need to be in the middle lane to follow the road ahead if we continue in this lane we're going to end up coming off the carriageway keep right then take the exit so we're gonna stay on this road we're currently in the normal driving lane to follow the road ahead as the left-hand lane is coming off the carriageway but as we continue ahead there is going to be a new left lane which gets added to the carriageway which then becomes a normal driving lane so as we continue we need to switch back into the left-hand lane and not to continue in the middle if you continue driving in the middle lane and the left hand lane is available you will get marked down for this as you're in the overtaking lane,585.76,648.079,757,166,fdausOL9QOM,1716,https://youtu.be/fdausOL9QOM?t=585,
so,666.24,666.24,2,1,fdausOL9QOM,1716,https://youtu.be/fdausOL9QOM?t=666,
take the exit towards harrow then go straight on,690.56,693.6,48,10,fdausOL9QOM,1716,https://youtu.be/fdausOL9QOM?t=690,
[Music] and take the third exit [Music] go right on the roundabout and take the third exit a4127 towards south [Music] as we're going around the roundabout millie does check her mirrors to be able to switch into the left hand lane to be able to exit the roundabout more easily but she's not able to straight away so she stays in the overtaking lane take the exit a4127 millie can switch into the left-hand lane to exit or she can simply stay on the right to exit in the right-hand lane as there is space for two cars [Music] coming up to this next stop millie starts signalling but doesn't intend on stopping straight away there was a junction in between so she should have switched off her signal and reapplied after the turn she keeps it running so gets a minor fault for this but if there was a vehicle waiting in that junction this could have been a serious or dangerous fault,726.88,829.519,880,190,fdausOL9QOM,1716,https://youtu.be/fdausOL9QOM?t=726,
drive off whenever you're ready the traffic on the main road is fairly busy so there were no obvious gaps to move straight away now there was a gap that miley tries to take but she hesitates this wouldn't necessarily go down as a fault unless when moving away from the side of the road she obstructed a vehicle oncoming sorry,848.959,881.519,325,67,fdausOL9QOM,1716,https://youtu.be/fdausOL9QOM?t=848,

you can just go around towards the left here okay what i'd like you to do many is to forward park into a space of your choice make sure you finish within the white lines of the bay okay,1059.76,1071.919,185,40,fdausOL9QOM,1716,https://youtu.be/fdausOL9QOM?t=1059,
millie does park in the space straight away but she wasn't sure of her position so she drives into the space ahead and then reverses back as she was already in the space this did not give her a minor fault for control,1086.96,1097.84,217,46,fdausOL9QOM,1716,https://youtu.be/fdausOL9QOM?t=1086,

on the left don't worry about the driveways just kind of in this space here all right what we're going to do now is i'm going to get you to carry out the emergency stop as you're driving down this road i'm going to look around and make sure it's nice and safe and i'm going to give you this signal stop as soon as you get that signal i want you to stop the car as quickly and as safely as possible okay okay but wait for my signal before you carry out this yeah okay sorry i'm just clearing the back so your bag run around okay let's drive off when you're ready [Music] stop okay i'm gonna get you to do that one more time whenever you're ready let's drive off [Music],1295.919,1377.0,668,153,fdausOL9QOM,1716,https://youtu.be/fdausOL9QOM?t=1295,
so continued driving is normal and we're still doing the emergency stop but not when there's anyone in front okay so wait for the road to be clear [Music] stop thank you i'm not going to be asking you to do that again drive off when you're ready and then turn left [Music] if you can pull it and park up on the left just behind the roads caught in that space right there yeah just go a little bit further slow it right down and we're gonna be leaving the car thank you yeah okay yeah sorry yes secure the car please and you can switch off the engine as well okay [Music] all right emily that's the end of your test how was your drive today um it was okay i felt like that was something would you say there were any serious faults at all um i think i think maybe yeah that would be a pass definitely really but with a bit of a telling off yeah i know i was i knew that's just a few points i,1396.0,1492.88,889,197,fdausOL9QOM,1716,https://youtu.be/fdausOL9QOM?t=1396,
was like she's gonna there's a little telling off in places but yeah it would be a pass though overall i would say it was quite a challenging route okay and you did do really well i think i found it harder than one of the other ones i don't know it was quite a challenging route there's a lot going on on that uh that route especially with um the big roundabouts carriageways small roads you dealt with it all really nicely um what i want to talk about is your signal timed yeah is it too late too early for you know on one of the roundabouts when you were going right um yeah the one where you stalled oh yeah yeah you were going round the roundabout with the right signal yeah now second exit is still in front of us we haven't passed it yet oh and you've started signaling left computer yeah so that signal could have very easily been a serious had somebody now moved in front of you because of that but because,1495.12,1540.159,914,192,fdausOL9QOM,1716,https://youtu.be/fdausOL9QOM?t=1495,
it's quite spaced out it wasn't that bad but just kind of reached my brain when because i was moving over i think that's why i did it yeah it was just a little early and then the same thing happened again when i asked you to park up the second time so we're driving on greenfield road and i that road there's a junction i i know this staff yeah um and then right at the beginning you know when you tried to overtake that bus yeah i know that bus had a right signal and you were trying to go around him but um yeah you kind of managed it quite quickly but before going around that bus what's the first thing we do the crown is taking off see if that bus is gonna yeah move because as you come up i know that was so as soon as you were coming up to that bus they had a right signal and i thought come on really just wait yeah that's it um and lastly again this one is one where i was thinking oh you know when we were white hot round,1541.76,1595.12,931,206,fdausOL9QOM,1716,https://youtu.be/fdausOL9QOM?t=1541,
about and you could hear sirens coming yeah like from somewhere i was just like yeah you kind of went in you went in cautiously but then you steered left and there was nobody next to you but you kind of moved over that white line a little bit yeah i know that because i didn't i felt like i didn't go like you didn't i went yeah straight well you tell me not to do i literally went i know i literally did it and i was like oh yes that's good because i'm going into the other people's and how was your first emergency stop that's really slow i was really slow definitely would not have saved that child at that rate but the second one was that okay it was much better yeah but you know it's an emergency stop get that break on it was just like you were trying to break like i was like i don't know why i know i agree and i was itching i was like yeah song was that,1596.88,1642.399,863,190,fdausOL9QOM,1716,https://youtu.be/fdausOL9QOM?t=1596,
happy and your bay park forward was really nice i would strongly suggest putting on a signal okay before doing it that's true i don't know why you know what the funny thing was you went into the space really nicely but i was worried that i was like because i felt like i was wonky because the car park was confusing can't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with that now i saw these other like because the things in front they're not as straight and then the ones that i don't know it was just coming it was all a bit wonky but you were in the space nicely i just went four because i was worried and then i just reversed back but because you were already in the space in one go you simply went forward and back yeah but you were in the same spot the whole time it wasn't even enough to be a minor okay because you didn't need to adjust it yeah okay yeah i'll just be more confident i'm in the space yeah,1644.64,1686.08,885,195,fdausOL9QOM,1716,https://youtu.be/fdausOL9QOM?t=1644,
yeah but yeah it was just the signal timing and that that kind of lit the lane thingy but really like that either thank you all right guys thank you for everyone that's been watching we'll keep you posted with how the test goes i know you're going to be a nervous wreck on the door i'm expecting it already all right well thank you everyone for watching and bye [Music],1687.679,1714.16,369,78,fdausOL9QOM,1716,https://youtu.be/fdausOL9QOM?t=1687,

the only place i ever think i'd maybe get something he's on a roundabout but i can do those i just need to follow the road markings i am going to be a while i've got quite a challenging route for you are you ready for this yes one okay hi guys welcome back to clearview driving today i'm doing a mock test with flynn now we've been doing lessons together right from the very beginning from a complete beginner we've done around 18 hours his test is coming up in about a week's time and this is his first official mock test how are you feeling yeah i'm feeling good okay now we have got quite a challenging route because putting him through his paces see how he does and if there's any any concerns at least we'll know what to do going further now i'm going to get you to follow the stat now for the first 15-20 minutes or so and then i'll give you some instructions afterwards we're,35.36,79.84,882,193,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=35,
going to do one maneuver and we may also carry out the emergency stop now before we get started i'm going to ask you a quick question could you tell me how would you check that the brake lights were working you'd break and check the reflections of of card line okay perfect glad we got there on that one all right so for anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe if you haven't already and i'm gonna put a link in the description if you're looking for temporary car insurance so go use the link now you ready to start [Music] okay hopefully should start to speak soon [Music] after 90 yards go left on the roundabout and take the first exit go left on the roundabout and take the first exit,81.68,166.319,745,157,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=81,
when driving on a road like this with lots of parked vehicles it's really important to be regularly checking your mirrors so when you're moving your position towards the left you want to check top and left and when you're giving way to traffic before moving off you should check top and right mirror does get a serious fault for move-off safety at this point as he waits to give way to oncoming traffic before moving off he should have checked his mirrors towards the right as there was a motorbike on the right who was trying to get through [Music] driving in busy areas like this it's really important to be regularly checking your mirrors as motorbikes and cyclists can easily turn up and they don't need a lot of space to get through as there are part vehicles on both sides of the road aim to have the center line of the road on your left shoulder ahead of us is a meeting situation where somebody is giving way and flynn ends up,188.959,252.4,934,188,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=188,
getting a clearance fall as he gets too close to the parked car on the left as their wing mirror is not folded after 200 yards turn left b455 then take the second right approaching this left turn flynn doesn't check his left mirror before indicating but as he passes the last part vehicle he does check his mirrors before moving over so this does not get counted as a fault as he is checking his mirrors and nobody is behind him flynn does turn into the road really nicely but he is driving slightly over the center white line it is slightly faded at this point and there's no cars in front so nobody's affected by this but he should have been more towards the left he does move over turn right [Music] turn right [Music],254.319,327.93,721,148,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=254,

thank you drive up on if you're ready [Music] coming up to this next right turn flynn does signal a bit early but nobody's affected by this and there are no junctions on the right hand side so this isn't necessarily a fault but aim to signal about six car lengths as we're traveling quite slowly turn right then cross the roundabout and take the second exit,382.96,424.16,357,76,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=382,
coming up to this first mini roundabout to follow the road ahead flynn doesn't look across to the right but the roundabout is really open and we can see quite clearly now this wouldn't go down as a fault as we can see it but you should always look across across the roundabout now on the next roundabout we couldn't see very clearly but there was a bus that was blocking the right hand side of the road completely so again this wouldn't go down as a fault as nobody was to the right and the bus was blocking,445.599,475.919,507,108,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=445,
cross the roundabout and take the second exit then turn left,496.08,498.4,60,12,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=496,
so turn left,513.599,525.2,12,3,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=513,
after 150 yards turn left a40 as the obstructions on the left-hand side of the road we did need to stop for oncoming traffic but it would have been a better idea to stop slightly further back so that the cars in front have more space to maneuver around us at the end of the road turn left turn left when waiting to turn left at this junction flynn does wait for a safe gap and waits for both lanes to be clear before moving forward but he does move off a little bit too early getting a bit close to the white car flynn does make really good progress with speed and gets up to the speed of the road but the traffic ahead is moving slowly so he has to adjust before he joins the carriageway the traffic on the main road is not driving up to the speed of the road which is 40 miles per hour flynn's initially following at a good distance but ends up following too closely to the white car ahead always try to maintain,541.68,623.12,914,195,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=541,
at least a two second following distance and you can use the phrase only a fall breaks a two second rule you could use a marker pose when the vehicle in front passes and then say the phrase and we shouldn't pass the same marker before the end of the phrase this is a good way of maintaining a good following distance at all times so after 800 yards keep right,625.519,663.68,359,73,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=625,
i'd suggest you move into this we're going to be staying on this road at this point the sat nav is saying keep right which means that we need to stay on this carriageway for a bit longer the left-hand lane is going to come off the carriageway so the middle lane becomes the normal driving position for following the road ahead after one mile take the exit 55 towards ricin,684.0,717.839,372,82,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=684,
as we're going a bit further there's a sign on the left hand side which shows us that there's going to be a new lane being added to the carriageway so flynn needs to move into this new lane as that becomes the normal driving position and the middle lane becomes the overtaking lane after 800 yards take the exit b455 towards right slip then go left on the roundabout and take the first exit as the exit's coming up shortly and we're in the middle lane i did have to remind flynn that we are taking the exit he did try to move over but he was trying to overtake the silver car and then move into the left-hand lane ahead of them it's never safe to overtake and then slow down just in front of someone it would have been better to slow down and get in behind the silver car instead a4180 b45 take the exit then go left on the roundabout and take the first exit,742.32,802.72,858,192,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=742,
now flynn does make the right decision of holding off and not trying to switch into the left as he realized it would have been quite dangerous so he switches off his signal and carries on driving ahead but as we're going a bit further ahead it goes up to a 70 miles per hour zone he didn't realize this as a speed has just switched from 50 to 70 miles per hour the traffic is not up to the speed of the road and generally the left hand lane tends to be a lot slower as there is an exit coming in so after 1.2 miles take the exit if you end up going the wrong way the sat nav will redirect you or the examiner would say i'm going to give you instructions as normal but in this case there was no other alternative route so flynn had to carry on following the satnav we're currently only driving between 45 to 50 miles per hour on a 70 miles per hour road now the two options here would,826.399,904.8,883,196,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=826,
be to overtake the silver car in front who is driving slowly or to drop back from the vehicle ahead it wasn't necessarily to overtake this vehicle as there is more traffic ahead and we are taking the exit so we should have dropped back instead we need to increase the distance ahead okay you need to increase the distance you're following too close [Music],906.959,943.76,356,71,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=906,
so once on the exit flynn stays in the right hand lane as he realizes he needs to take the exit towards the right [Music],960.8,983.09,121,28,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=960,
after 100 yards bare right a437 towards central london bear right is that's this is 70 right by the way on this i'm missing that turning was not a good idea [Music] hmm carry on just carry on driving normally okay don't think about it as we started the right turn at the brow of the hill the road is now on a downhill slope and flynn needed to make a wide turn to turn into the left-hand lane he turns straight into the right-hand lane and cuts off the vehicle on the right,1007.519,1073.36,473,105,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=1007,
[Music],1095.13,1095.13,7,3,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=1095,
take the exit then go right on the roundabout and take the third exit after 300 yards go right on the roundabout and take the third exit a4180 b455 towards south all go right on the roundabout and take the third exit,1110.64,1136.48,216,49,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=1110,
safe before going into the roundabout flynn knew he was in the wrong lane and he thoroughly checked towards the right he checked his mirrors and his blind spot nobody was to his right so this did not give him a serious fault with what he was doing as he did make sure it was safe when passing exit number two flynn does signal to exit but he doesn't check his mirrors until quite late now on this particular occasion there were two lanes to exit so he did check right by the end and exit on the right but on some roundabouts there may only be one lane leaving so it's a good idea to move into the left hand lane coming up to your exit [Music] all right what i'd like you to do now is to forward park into a space of your choice make sure you finish within the white lines of the bay [Music],1158.799,1215.63,790,170,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=1158,

you happy sleep is that yep okay okay let's reverse that when you're ready i'm going to give you normal instructions from now on so you're no longer following the satellite okay,1297.36,1309.76,177,37,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=1297,

okay we're gonna take the second exit at the roundabout going towards greenfield [Music] flynn follows the roundabout round really nicely keeping to the outskirts as we're taking the second exit he doesn't check his left mirror but he does signal but this doesn't go down as a fault as we're already in the left hand lane and nobody could be on our left could you show me how you check the horns working okay all right if you can turn left into this carpet just here,1386.32,1452.72,466,98,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=1386,
all right if you can forward park into a space of your choice make sure you finish within the lines,1474.799,1477.6,99,20,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=1474,
you can just drive into the one on the other side it's okay that's great though thank you secure the car brilliant all right you can relax give me a few minutes that is the end of your driving test [Music] all right flynn that's the end of your test how was your drive uh well it started well but then as i missed that until the exit of the motorway it was going fine nothing wrong and then after i after i sort of missed the exercise okay i was panicking because i mean i'm fine with unfamiliar roads yeah okay where am i how far is the next exit it definitely got a little bit downhill after that point definitely exiting that motorway i was fine yeah and then getting back round to the turning where you joined was fine when i was joining that turn that bit was yeah that was fair enough okay so unfortunately no it wouldn't be a pass there's quite a few things that went wrong um the thing is the drive was good,1499.679,1561.2,915,193,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=1499,
but there were some moments where you didn't realize you're making a fault and that's what this whole mock test is to highlight okay so first of all as we were driving earlier there was um a point where i think it was like a bmw in front of you i can't remember the car but we're on forty road you joined on you were driving too close you you had about what looked like two car lengths and i know it's a 40 road but you're trying to drive at 35 40 but the car cars in front just they're not allowing for that so what what should we do at that point slow down slow down yeah so we needed to maintain that distance in front but we kept closing into that gap and um unfortunately you got a serious fault for following distance at that point then as we're going forward um it was a 40 road you know where i said the sac level saying keep right keep right and that's when i said oh i'd suggest you,1563.6,1611.36,892,198,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=1563,
move into the middle lane you moved into the middle lane and then we're going forward it's 40 miles per hour still but you're up to about 45 plus so i had to tell you support your road so again that would be a serious fault because you're over the speed limit some of these things you might not have realized are serious yeah yeah and then as we're going forward obviously the sat nav was now telling you take the exit take the exit and it was saying 800 yards exit so your plan should have been to move into the left lane um and then i had to again tell you were taking the exit and now the exits getting closer and closer and there was that silver car on the left now is it safe to overtake them move in front of them and then exit what should you have done slowed down and bombed behind them but i wasn't yeah yeah see it's not an issue slowing down a little bit it wasn't like we would have been,1612.72,1659.12,899,194,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=1612,
slowing down by a lot but we just needed to adjust our speed downwards and go behind it was not safe to go in front it's like if there was a cyclist on a road would you overtake that cyclist to make a left turn same thing right so we definitely should not have been trying to overtake that and as soon as you realize you were about to do that you were like i'll forget it but now that put you on a 70. i'm i am majorly concerned about what happened at that right turn you know when you realize that the 70 bit so you there were two lanes turning right you were in the first one actually you just kept going around you needed to make that wide turn rather than like that because you pissed off the purple car driver completely it was so sudden because it was on a little brow so i couldn't exactly see where you were darting for but then when we got there i was like oh god it's going in the right lane uh,1660.32,1707.12,904,198,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=1660,
but yeah it was a bit of a snowball effect wasn't it yeah yeah yeah it was and there's everything up until i got on off earth kept going on the mower it was finally check the speed behind that car yeah yeah following distance yeah yeah um and then there was that roundabout where i just ended up laughing by the end of it because you knew you were in the wrong lane now at that point what should you do you're in the left lane at a roundabout what are your two options well one is white because it was pretty clear yeah i know you checked i know i can't i can't fail you for that at all you did definitely check but the test scenario realistically i would have preferred if you just went left left or go straight okay don't try and turn right from that lane and i know you signaled you checked and it was really really clear but um yeah we definitely should have been approaching on the right okay this last round about here perfect no concerns,1708.64,1762.08,944,195,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=1708,
coming off this road it's 20 miles per hour you did got 26 again so you need to realize when it's 20 it's 20. so yeah so like these kind of things definitely need tweaking um i did expect a few faults today because like i said at the beginning it is a challenging route but i had to cut it short because we kind of went on a bit of a detour of our own um and even forward bay parking that's awful you've done it's like this is so much better than what you did over there because because i decided to go into a left space yeah space i should have gone into the right space they're all empty you should have gone in the right one yeah so this was good like that this is fine and also when it's empty which it probably will be in the morning yeah then i'll just do that but um did you know by the end of it you weren't in the space yeah no i know i just couldn't be asked to go here again,1764.0,1813.36,885,204,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=1764,
you know when you reverse the second time you didn't look over your left shoulder and it's the one-way road so we should have looked over so that did give you a serious help for not looking around now as well um but before reversing you look like that and i would literally if i if this is the space i would come out the space even if i'm not in i would come out the space fully and then at least you'll have a better idea of what you're driving into you kind of drove out a little bit and then forward and you really couldn't make a make much better you missed the first so you miss it on the first turn yeah i can't feel you for coming back out and going back no okay as long as you come back out and you're in by the end okay okay okay so there's lots of good bits in there but there's a few bits we definitely need to clear up and that's what we're gonna go to now,1816.559,1858.24,868,194,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=1816,
so thank you for everyone that has been watching today's video hopefully it's been useful um there is a lot going on but this is exactly what the purpose of this mock test was to highlight the issues so that we can sort it all out see you in the next video thank you for watching how you feeling don't worry we'll sort it out,1860.08,1880.32,325,69,QT9IFzJIMHM,1884,https://youtu.be/QT9IFzJIMHM?t=1860,

should we have a restart these guys get a bit nervous okay you ready we're gonna start again because you are very nervous right now okay yeah let's do a left in here in here yeah yeah into this road so signal and turn into this road this this way and just keep going so to stop the car it's just going to be a little bit break and full clutch so do that now you got it no you got it yeah pause now pop it in first gear can i tell you what you're doing with your steering you're holding it for dear life yeah that's why you're wandering off over here because you're holding on to it like this so just loosen your grip and you'll be fine okay okay so now feet ready just try moving off again that was not good that was not good that was one of his worst starts oh definitely uh oh well i can't really say anything right now but relax a bit yeah are you okay i think so,191.92,260.479,866,190,_1tWhgxfvHk,1359,https://youtu.be/_1tWhgxfvHk?t=191,
okay if we do this mock test today we're not gonna start here we're not to stop by this roundabout because you're going to be nervous coming out onto that roundabout and i can see it going quite badly just purely because it's it's a busy round but you've got to be confident okay i think i'm fine though yeah i think so you you back to yourself yeah all right okay fine okay all right when you're ready so let's start the engine,263.759,296.88,428,95,_1tWhgxfvHk,1359,https://youtu.be/_1tWhgxfvHk?t=263,

there's no space for you to turn is it not wait wait wait wait wait well trail backwards well there's a car there yeah you want to turn where you haven't steered enough you're gonna hit it oh okay okay okay okay just wait for that car oh so i didn't teach you this bit go on turn it all the way and there we go slowly okay okay [Music] a second [Music] after 300 yards turn left so following the sat nav again just take your time with it,348.479,434.16,437,101,_1tWhgxfvHk,1359,https://youtu.be/_1tWhgxfvHk?t=348,
oh yeah all right let me take control release your pedals release it all right back to you we're just gonna go and stop somewhere okay just not drive normally just keep going forward keep going forward and we're gonna go ahead okay don't turn left just go ahead turn left so just ignore the stat now we're going ahead okay [Music] just go ahead there was a call coming i think just just stop that stop there break clutch i'm gonna take control okay release your pedals completely don't press anything for me all right we're going to do a driving lesson and not a mock test after this what's what say calling turn towards me just drive down the road just drive a driving lesson what do you think how would you feel about that yeah he needs it look he's not putting the clutch down he's trying to go into fourth gear so we're we're a little bit all over the place take your time can i take control just don't press anything okay,454.8,548.399,926,192,_1tWhgxfvHk,1359,https://youtu.be/_1tWhgxfvHk?t=454,
i'm going to completely just take control at this point and i'm just going to stop actually uh yeah tell me that that would okay i thought it was ready all right i thought it was ready i thought i feel bad like you you clearly do need a lot of practice uh you haven't been taught the basics okay from somebody in the back there it's not your fault that's my dream career over there i think you can carry on driving you just can't teach yeah i think i'll take over yeah i think you need to but uh yeah we uh we're gonna do a driving lesson or yeah so we can do one of two things it's up to you we could do a driving lesson jim now how do you how would you feel about that have you ever done a driving lesson it's a driving lesson where i'm going to literally tell you what's what but before we do that i want to kind of go over the basics with you so you've got a good understanding of what it is you're,550.32,602.959,902,202,_1tWhgxfvHk,1359,https://youtu.be/_1tWhgxfvHk?t=550,
doing because at the moment right now the understanding's not right fully there you just kind of you're just doing it because i'm asking you to do it okay yeah yeah i'm not having a go that's fine i'm not having a go sounds fair yeah okay that's fine okay so we're now doing a driving lesson not a mock test because um juvenile does need the practice and we're just gonna start off with the basics we're going to start off with like a talk through and see how you get on and then hopefully as we're going i'll be able to cut down my instructions okay so when you're ready let's start the engine brilliant i want you to show me how you move off but remember to check over your shoulder before moving okay brilliant so pop it into first gear should we take that gap good signal as well upwards and just check over your right shoulder as a final check and move your right foot into position ever so lightly,604.32,665.279,903,189,_1tWhgxfvHk,1359,https://youtu.be/_1tWhgxfvHk?t=604,
press in the accelerator as you go now that was really nice just keep going now we're going to go straight from here you see the left pavement sticks out a little bit do you want to keep away from that just keep going all the way so to stop the car think about your pedals brilliant and pause okay so watching my hands for a second so this is how you are waiting at the moment when it goes amber your right foot needs to go across your left needs to come halfway so it's that movement okay yeah it's that balance on the two so you move right foot when it's on but yeah and then at the same time bring your left foot up so hands ready on the wheel you can move your right foot across right now because we're on flat surface anyways just right okay so as it goes on but it's going to be accelerate and clutch up a little bit just focus on your clutch nothing else now accelerate and just check your right mirror because the two lanes merge now,667.92,720.56,941,195,_1tWhgxfvHk,1359,https://youtu.be/_1tWhgxfvHk?t=667,
let's go nice and quickly really quickly stepping off the accelerator clutch down we're gonna go second gear not wasting time really nice how many seconds to release three brilliant done now we can get through that can't we okay is anyone behind you no looking in the top good now you see that bmw yeah what are we going to do with it yeah let's do around it then get a little bit of break because now the blue car's a bit closer to the island tiny bit of break and you just got to wiggle your way through so kind of turn in thank you there you go and carry on all right is anyone behind you no what mirror are you looking at that one yeah a bit to the right of it to the right kid because they're sticking out and they're parked in a really bad spot there and again we're going to go around this class we're going to move over nice and early good come back in line a little bit just keep it straight so what speed are you traveling at the moment,722.48,787.6,946,202,_1tWhgxfvHk,1359,https://youtu.be/_1tWhgxfvHk?t=722,
okay brilliant now in a little while i'm going to ask you to pull over and park on the left don't pull in too suddenly okay you could just keep it out or a little bit break speed they're not that high anyways they're not like the ones we had earlier come on keep it to the right philly bit more to you brilliant so we're going to pull in after the island somewhere on the left there's no rush but we need to tell the person behind that we're parking so you see where that car is which one um keep going forward again i know i should have said a color i'm sorry um carry on going all right you see the second speed bump just before it so get around this car get around them get to give them a bit more space now signal start braking indicator down yeah brake and clutch keep braking move away slightly and keep braking keep braking keep braking keep braking come on okay in terms of stopping we're just,789.2,846.48,901,189,_1tWhgxfvHk,1359,https://youtu.be/_1tWhgxfvHk?t=789,
trying to get over to the side we don't want to park on the pavement like everyone else okay okay okay we're just gonna be on the road now when we move off from here you're gonna need to make sure you steer yeah okay so pop it into first gear and move your right foot where does it need to be brilliant and now check behind you we're gonna go before the learner they're quite far signal don't go now and we also need to check over to the to the right blind spot now now we stalled there yeah but it's okay your clutch was too fast just bring it up a tiny bit but don't let go this is tricky keep it there you go now turn it towards you a lot more i'm just checking that slide again brilliant tell it to me now on the accelerator bit more bit more we're going to turn left at this roundabout so check this mirror here and this one here and signal left corner left and have a look at that blue car,847.76,909.839,895,196,_1tWhgxfvHk,1359,https://youtu.be/_1tWhgxfvHk?t=847,
and that black car we can keep going go and turn it towards me and look where you're going look into the road turn a little bit and see how it's going don't turn it back too suddenly there we go turn it back now speed up now we're going to go into second gear step off the accelerator clutch down switch like we talked about good and three two one we're gonna pop in the shade of the second tree it's a signal left just checking top and left now start with your feet what are you pressing good and then move away slightly break and yeah and she keeps yeah breaking breaking just stop right there try and leave yourself a bit more space from parked cars because otherwise you're gonna have a hard time moving off right you can put into neutral every time you stop as well okay all right you ready to go again should we try another okay okay so into first gear and then where are you gonna look before moving away what do we do with that indicator switch it yeah i forgot to tell you to turn it off sorry,910.72,975.519,1002,206,_1tWhgxfvHk,1359,https://youtu.be/_1tWhgxfvHk?t=910,
is it clear yep yeah okay so thinking about like clutch control and how you're going to get out of this spot you want to turn it wiggle your weight there is it very nice now let's go a little bit quicker brilliant do you hear that that sound what does it mean no it means we need to change gears oh okay yeah should we do that so change here and then three two back on the accelerator the lady behind is a bit impatient can you see her good just keep going rightfully so we are going a bit slow so just check your mirrors she's a bit close so make sure you break you don't break sun just move it to the right slightly and step off the accelerator keep it in the middle keep it in the middle we're going to talk about this position in a second just step off the accelerator all right hold it there just keep this position okay we're gonna go ahead just go straight and break lightly clutch down and break lightly okay,976.8,1045.839,916,191,_1tWhgxfvHk,1359,https://youtu.be/_1tWhgxfvHk?t=976,
i swear she couldn't be any closer yeah she was pretty close yeah you ready to go again yeah yeah are you ready though is the car ready brilliant now with your feet move your right foot over looking ahead we can go now don't worry clutch down go and try again she's being a real arse going off he goes like is hooting really gonna help make the situation any better go on in you go brilliant and then you can hear the sound all done now is anyone behind you that's good we look in the top mirror because the top mirror is accurate okay in terms of distance now what do we see in front of us okay so we're gonna go straight so you can see the car in front it's not indicating just look across to the right we're gonna go straight okay you can keep going it's all clear isn't it and just go ahead and there we are now we're gonna stop in the shade of the tree on the left you see the last bit of,1048.559,1120.16,893,196,_1tWhgxfvHk,1359,https://youtu.be/_1tWhgxfvHk?t=1048,

left then go left on the roundabout and take the second exit take the second left [Music] hi guys welcome back to clearview driving my name is aman and today i'm doing a mock test with surya now he's traveled down all the way from sally hall to do this mock test now you've already got quite a few years of experience about what was it 10 to 12 years you said yeah of driving in india and you have done some lessons here as well yeah but you don't currently have a test book tour not no not no future yeah we i booked it on to the month of november okay but you'd like to bring your test forward yeah okay so today's the mock test is just to gauge where he's at and if there's any concerns if i can give him any feedback so um before we get started throughout the drive i'm going to just get you to follow the sat nav for um the independent driving part of the uh,0.08,72.72,863,194,Jw-DZu9qlh8,1528,https://youtu.be/Jw-DZu9qlh8?t=0,
test don't worry it's gonna go away um i will give you instructions outside of that when the sat nav turns off we're gonna do one maneuver and we may also do the emergency stop yeah okay similar to everything you've already been practicing with your instructor okay all right so if anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe if you haven't already i hope you guys enjoy the content and actually learn something along the way now i'm going to put a link down in the description if anybody is looking for temporary insurance so you guys can have a look at that um i'm gonna yeah when you're ready we're gonna get started when moving off from stationary you should always repair the car and then look all around and lastly move off when it's safe surreal looks all around and then prepares the car now this isn't an issue as long as you look around again before moving off now he gets marked down for moving off,74.56,133.36,962,194,Jw-DZu9qlh8,1528,https://youtu.be/Jw-DZu9qlh8?t=74,
safety as he has not checked his right blind spot again and it's been some time if somebody had been on the right this would have been a serious fault so always remember to do your right blind spot check as a final check [Music] at the end of the road turn left b470 coming up to the road works ahead the left hand lane is obstructed although we are making a left turn it would have been a better idea to position in the right hand lane as we need to move around the roadworks from the right surreal positions in the left now this isn't necessarily a fault because the lane isn't closed yet but it would have been good awareness and planning to position on the right a little bit earlier [Music] turn left b470 [Music] as we get onto the new road sorry it does realize it's a 30 miles per hour road but he uses second gear for longer in order to speed up quicker and he goes into third gear when we get to the brow,135.04,201.599,914,198,Jw-DZu9qlh8,1528,https://youtu.be/Jw-DZu9qlh8?t=135,
of the hill [Music] as we go further down the road there is a national speed limit on the left hand side of the road as we're on a single carriageway the speed limit is now 60 miles per hour there are also no street lamps along this road which means that there are going to be no reminders after this point that the speed limit is 60 but you would only drive up to that speed limit if it's safe to do so if there are street lamps present and there's no signs it means that the speed limit is 30 miles per hour anything above or below that number you will get a constant reminder on the road if there are no street lamps and no signs that means that on a single carriageway the speed limit would be 60 and on a dual carriageway the speed limit would be 70. as we go slightly further down this road we go back into a 40 miles per hour zone where there are,203.44,251.76,853,195,Jw-DZu9qlh8,1528,https://youtu.be/Jw-DZu9qlh8?t=203,
street lamps but there'll be signs throughout the road as a reminder after 300 yards go left on the roundabout and take the first exit go left on the roundabout and take the first exit on approach for this round about to turn left we could have carried on straight away as the bus on the right hand side was approaching with no indicator the second car was indicating to turn but we had enough time to continue as we wouldn't slow them down [Music],253.68,292.32,448,92,Jw-DZu9qlh8,1528,https://youtu.be/Jw-DZu9qlh8?t=253,
okay so when it's safe to do so i'd like you to demonstrate how you would wash the rear windscreen thank you go left on the roundabout and take the first exit as surya as an experienced driver some of the gaps that he's taking on the roundabouts most new drivers wouldn't take these gaps there was a van approaching on the right hand side now he gets a minor fault for the entry on this roundabout as he should have taken a safer gap if the van had been any faster this would have been a serious fault [Music] as soon as the left hand lane opens up on the carriageway soria make sure to switch into the left hand lane for position normal driving driving along this road surya continues driving in the left-hand lane making sure to make good progress with the speed of the road as well as maintaining a good following distance from traffic ahead in the distance the satnav is telling us to turn right but initially,310.32,392.72,913,191,Jw-DZu9qlh8,1528,https://youtu.be/Jw-DZu9qlh8?t=310,
the turn is about two to three miles away but as we're going a bit closer the satnav starts to give an audible warning that we need to turn right and as we're now traveling at 40 miles per hour it's a good idea to move over in good time so around five to six hundred yards would be good but if we were traveling faster you can move over earlier after 300 yards go right on the roundabout and take the third exit a4 after 300 yards go right on the roundabout and take the third exit a4 [Music] go right on the roundabout and take the third exit a4 so it starts around about really well by following the marking to the left hand side and going round in this lane as we go around this lane is now going to start to split into two and we need to keep to the left half in order to exit the roundabout more easily you can see the white line on the left and you simply follow it with your tyre you,394.88,471.28,890,199,Jw-DZu9qlh8,1528,https://youtu.be/Jw-DZu9qlh8?t=394,
don't need to switch your signal at this point you would check your mirror to the left to move over as we move forward from this point the traffic lights in the distance had changed to red but soria doesn't realize until quite late and he gets marked down for his control on foot brake as the brake was quite sharp take the exit a4 then take the second left,473.199,499.84,357,74,Jw-DZu9qlh8,1528,https://youtu.be/Jw-DZu9qlh8?t=473,
[Music] after 100 yards turn left turn left [Music] as there was another junction on the right before the one we're taking this could have been confusing had a vehicle been waiting on that entrance to come out,517.309,560.08,209,44,Jw-DZu9qlh8,1528,https://youtu.be/Jw-DZu9qlh8?t=517,
surya nearly gets a serious fault on approach to the zebra crossing as we're turning left there's a pedestrian on the right hand side who's approaching the crossing while on the phone now they're walking straight towards the road but as we get close to the end they happen to turn around now we can tell that the pedestrian was going to turn around at this point as it did look like they're about to cross the road now i didn't have to take control at this point as they're on the right hand side of the road and as we went forward the pedestrian happened to spin around but had the pedestrian been approaching from the left-hand side in the same way i would have had to take control as they would have been too close to the car to take the risk so always make sure when approaching a zebra crossing that's on a turn that we're slow enough to be able to stop if there are any pedestrians that are close,582.399,623.279,902,188,Jw-DZu9qlh8,1528,https://youtu.be/Jw-DZu9qlh8?t=582,
to the zebra crossing sorry carry on i'm sorry i thought he's gonna walk straight out sorry he was kind of just wondering wasn't he yeah actually he came in the that's what i was watching him only no i wasn't sure myself after 100 yards go left on the roundabout and take the second exit go left on the roundabout and take the second exit [Music] after 200 yards go left on the roundabout and take the second exit as we're taking the left on the roundabout but it's the second exit you would usually approach in the left hand lane unless road marking state otherwise and then as you enter the roundabout you follow the lane round and signal left after you've passed the first exit [Music] we're gonna turn right it's into a car park just up there close to the traffic lights there's the entrance okay so turn right after 300 yards turn left just ignore this uh sat nav for a second all right just go ahead from here okay,624.88,725.04,920,199,Jw-DZu9qlh8,1528,https://youtu.be/Jw-DZu9qlh8?t=624,
and then just go right again in there okay so what i'd like you to do now is to reverse into a space of your choice just make sure you finish within the white lines of the bay,726.88,738.639,175,39,Jw-DZu9qlh8,1528,https://youtu.be/Jw-DZu9qlh8?t=726,

so while reversing into the space as we were in between two spaces and had to go forward to readjust surya does get marked down for control and before starting to reverse he does not check over his right blind spots that also gets marked down for observation while reversing,811.839,838.8,274,52,Jw-DZu9qlh8,1528,https://youtu.be/Jw-DZu9qlh8?t=811,

you can just put it in park up on the right hand side kind of in between those cars doesn't need to be perfect [Music] i'm just keeping a little bit further that'd be great there thank you all right stuart at the end of your test how was your drive yeah a little bit stressful why was it stressful when it comes to when it comes to tests i think because of that maybe i think uh i don't know i mean uh first i think uh on the the moment we start the stress uh test uh he was uh the signal was there yeah i could have been uh waited be before that junction i think uh because i was obstacle for the uh cars which was going towards the no we weren't actually you know we weren't blocking the junction it was the cars behind you but you know you're making a left hand yeah the arrows in front are telling you to move right and you've positioned left and even signaled left so it's very confusing but,1203.28,1264.64,896,194,Jw-DZu9qlh8,1528,https://youtu.be/Jw-DZu9qlh8?t=1203,
we were supposed to take a left isn't it yeah true but you have to go around this obstruction okay to the right okay so your signal is a bit confusing even though you you're turning yeah yeah yeah yeah that's why those two cars went past you afterwards oh yes because of your position and signal so i would have just stayed on the right but come forward correct yeah um so overall it would be a pass but there's a few things i want to go over and you are an experienced driver you know what you're doing you're doing everything safely but um there wasn't there was a point where i thought don't like this you know with that white van it's on the roundabout when we did that left turn yeah there was a white van yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we shouldn't have we shouldn't have gone then actually i was thinking to wait but again like uh i don't know i'll take a judgment and i thought i'll move yeah so he was okay he,1267.84,1313.12,912,196,Jw-DZu9qlh8,1528,https://youtu.be/Jw-DZu9qlh8?t=1267,
didn't he didn't get like that yeah and he didn't pick up speed yeah but we shouldn't really be going because he's on the realm about coming in and you've just kind of been a bit cheeky and gone in before him yeah yeah so i wouldn't do that okay so um yeah the break was kind of what concerned me a little bit because sometimes the break would come in and it's a bit sharp okay so try to break light and gradual so the person behind kind of have a bit more time to react okay yeah following the sat nav was really nice um we had that bit with the pedestrian near the zebra crossing yeah yeah i know i was completely watching that guy yeah no i saw i saw and he was there waiting he was hesitating to either i crossed or he was on the phone i think isn't it true but what we should do there is we should have a slightly slower approach okay and what i didn't,1315.919,1355.76,857,189,Jw-DZu9qlh8,1528,https://youtu.be/Jw-DZu9qlh8?t=1315,
want is for him to step towards the road and then your harsh break oh yeah yeah so that's where my break the break is issue is a bit of a concern for me so i would say try and break light okay rather than kind of quick because if somebody behinds a bit close yeah and you're going to have trouble [Music] moving off safety at the very beginning you know when you couldn't figure out the handbrake yeah yeah so initially you looked all around yeah but then you were trying to figure out the handbrake and your attention is inside the car by the time you've moved off your blind spot check is now oh yeah too old so you needed to check again okay okay um yeah your maneuver your reverse yeah i don't know it is it's completely i mean because of a test pressure because i i've done every day in india we do every day yeah but i don't know it completely it went wrong then i realized because looking at the,1358.0,1406.32,902,194,Jw-DZu9qlh8,1528,https://youtu.be/Jw-DZu9qlh8?t=1358,
the car which is parked next to me i i understand this uh i got to know that i'm completing the wrong uh you're kind of in between yeah so i just but is that okay like but because you had to go forward and readjust yeah there was a blind spot check missing in the first half so you did get marked down for control and observation okay but that's not an issue as long as you're generally checking if you have to move around a little bit it's okay but you will get marked down for control for that okay okay yeah generally not a lot going on but it was the break that was a little bit concerning for me and that gap that you took with the van okay overall you know what you're doing great driving always driving at the speed of the road but it's just when that brake's coming in make it light yeah yeah yeah would you agree that the brake does come in a bit sharp yeah yeah because i was a little bit like it's completely a new car yeah and uh,1408.08,1454.4,941,202,Jw-DZu9qlh8,1528,https://youtu.be/Jw-DZu9qlh8?t=1408,
that side of it it's all because the brakes might be more sensitive in this car than the car you've been used to yeah yeah yeah so we gotta yeah uh i i thought i'll get uh the major one on the the bigger roundabout because uh was it okay like i followed the you followed your lane nicely but you nearly missed that red light yeah your break came in a bit harder yeah yeah yeah but because you did stop it's okay but that's again without break harsha's like he's going to miss it okay okay yeah so i i think what what section i i need to work on more it's more your awareness of how you're going to slow down for things okay making sure that you're lightly breaking because you are slowing down i don't feel like you're going to miss traffic lights miss round about smith things like that i just feel like you're going to break and get that breakdown harsh which then could be an issue for person behind you or you know,1457.679,1507.039,918,196,Jw-DZu9qlh8,1528,https://youtu.be/Jw-DZu9qlh8?t=1457,
so just be careful with how we're breaking as well because what if somebody behind you as well yeah yeah yeah yeah okay yeah thank you that's alright so that's the end of our mock test video today hopefully that video has been useful for you guys as well and don't forget to subscribe thank you you,1509.84,1528.08,298,61,Jw-DZu9qlh8,1528,https://youtu.be/Jw-DZu9qlh8?t=1509,

did you check the left mirror yeah okay i wouldn't go across that far okay that was your name okay so we started in lane two continue in that lane,200.319,209.84,146,31,No3iBDvD-Fc,855,https://youtu.be/No3iBDvD-Fc?t=200,
[Music] everywhere more or less so how would you know if it was 30 as we entered they have a sign signs okay at the roundabout turn right it's the second exit [Music],239.66,272.56,166,40,No3iBDvD-Fc,855,https://youtu.be/No3iBDvD-Fc?t=239,
it's really easy to miss um pedestrians and stuff with all the cones laid out so just be mindful of that all right so every time i'm asking you to turn left from right or you're moving your position even a little bit i want you to check top and then the direction you're moving and before and then right for that yes and before going down to third like from third to second like that definitely check the mirror break and then do it okay because whenever you change gear it causes the engine brake to slow you down right yeah so we don't want to do that without having checked the roads are quiet though it's good there's any select areas take the next road on your left [Music],292.0,345.59,678,140,No3iBDvD-Fc,855,https://youtu.be/No3iBDvD-Fc?t=292,
so did you see the speed signs on entry there yeah okay so if you look at this road this looks no different from the last road yeah but there are absolutely no signs and not that you can actually drive 30 right now anyways yeah but pick up the pace when it's clear like this so what would you say is a safe speed for this road 15 20. yeah about 20 20 22 i'd like you to turn left and then left again so it goes the same way [Music] yeah the other way would mainly just be if you wanted to make a right turn [Music] okay that's enough we've already made the two left oh right left and left yeah position back to the left now just drive on this side make sense yeah okay [Music] take the next road on your left,366.96,457.52,708,164,No3iBDvD-Fc,855,https://youtu.be/No3iBDvD-Fc?t=366,
take the next road on your right,486.8,486.8,32,7,No3iBDvD-Fc,855,https://youtu.be/No3iBDvD-Fc?t=486,
i would definitely be breaking that turn yeah take the left hand and the left side mirror again okay [Music] whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa okay slowly come out just just do the turn we're going to talk about that in a second okay all the way that silver car on the left right there look for would you stride normally did you realize how close you got to it yeah okay that was not just a minor fault though okay that would have been quite dangerous okay oh yeah i'm just going ahead so you can see the road ahead is to the right so position just keep going forward you can fit one car there that's it there all right so that was the car on the left this is you coming up forward you needed to stay parallel and then move on you kind of you're kind of putting in sort of tunnel vision you're kind of going like that okay yeah so we i'm surprised i didn't hit,502.319,583.68,871,194,No3iBDvD-Fc,855,https://youtu.be/No3iBDvD-Fc?t=502,
that's me exaggerating but you know um yeah we we definitely needed to keep our clearance there but it's okay these things happen but obviously they shouldn't be happening but yeah you live and learn so if you know you're going through a smaller gap what are you going to do next time get more clearance yeah and go slower to help you right [Music] see how much clearance that bus was leaving with the silver car yeah [Music] all right so roundabout follow the road ahead second exit and then turn left so that's a head second exit and then left turn to marina yeah but the left hand comes in fairly soon [Music],587.92,654.78,612,129,No3iBDvD-Fc,855,https://youtu.be/No3iBDvD-Fc?t=587,
can we take it no it's one of those ones we have to really go for if you're going to take it no i'd rather wait really quickly and just check this left side because you get a lot of times people kind of cut in yeah [Music] we're good this is one of those corners where everybody wants to put the clutch down all good yep okay so the traffic on the roundabout is nice but you've got to be a bit more confident to really go for it because if the traffic was fast-paced we wouldn't find an ideal gap all right so how are you feeling about your drive this morning yeah it was good just need to watch the uh clearance on a couple of times in turns so with that clearance issue that was by far the biggest issue we've had today on the other occasions you've been checking um so obviously if you know you're going through a smaller space how are you gonna just keep my distance and then come true,685.6,752.8,889,192,No3iBDvD-Fc,855,https://youtu.be/No3iBDvD-Fc?t=685,
what if you need to get close slow down good speed speed control is how you're gonna deal with that space okay but yeah if you don't wanna if you don't wanna get that close don't do it yeah i'm all good so it's nearly time we're just gonna go to the test center now and then we'll keep you guys updated with the results,755.12,770.56,319,73,No3iBDvD-Fc,855,https://youtu.be/No3iBDvD-Fc?t=755,
so [Music] but how was the maneuver oh that was good yeah yeah i was good i just controlled it and then when i came back fast too fast about just bringing to them yeah okay well guys he's back and he has done it he's passed it's really well done how are you feeling were you nervous beforehand a little bit but not not really just because you know what happened at the beginning when the examiner said to you could you tell me how you would i know your breaks are working you [Music] that was the first well that was the only thing really yeah but that's not a fault because you got there in the end it was just at the very beginning hello really well done and thank you for everyone that's been watching hopefully the videos have been useful bye for now [Music],786.959,849.88,762,160,No3iBDvD-Fc,855,https://youtu.be/No3iBDvD-Fc?t=786,
i'm sorry stop i think i'm ready okay perfect so we're gonna get started now so hi guys welcome back to clearview driving my name is aman and today i'm doing a mock test with luke now this is the first time we're driving together and you've traveled uh to london all the way from swindon so quite the journey and you've got oh we've got rj in the back there he's thought he's a companion along with him to see how he gets on um you've got your test coming up in just over a week's time just well actually that's 10 days 10 days 10 days or so now we're in a completely new area completely new car so we're going to see how you get on and if there's any advice going forward now do you know what's involved in a mock test do you want me to tell you a little bit i've got a pretty good idea okay that,7.919,70.72,797,191,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=7,
sounds good so we'll keep telling you where to go if not go straight all right okay so we're gonna get straight into it so um before we get started i'm gonna ask you a quick question okay could you tell me where would you find the information for the recommended tire pressure and how do you check this oh um so there's gonna be a handbook in uh in that thing okay um and to check the tire pressure i think is normally a gauge okay sounds good all right so for anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe if you've not already you ready to get started okay so i'm ready whenever you're ready let's get driving just [Music] hi guys welcome back to another mock test if you enjoy watching these videos don't forget to give it a thumbs up and share the video now as we're going a bit further down this road luke has a meeting situation with a silver car that's coming towards us now he does,73.119,156.319,940,199,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=73,
adjust his speed but he ends up getting a bit close to the black car on the left-hand side it's best to try and meet the traffic where there's no cars around you so he should have adjusted his speed a little bit earlier to avoid getting so close otherwise you'll end up getting a clearance fault [Music] all right if it can just get you to pull over and park up on the left-hand side of the road anyway don't worry about the driveways on this occasion just leave enough space to move away okay all right thank you drive often if you're ready,158.4,203.76,541,115,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=158,
the first time luke tried to move off he brought the clutch up too quickly which is why he stalled when moving off on an uphill gradient you have to accelerate more than usual and hold the clutch steady for longer until you start rolling [Music] so,222.319,249.68,248,50,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=222,
and take the next road on your left as we're turning into this new road luke is braking while being in second gear but breaks too much for second gear causing the engine to switch off as he's turning the vehicles behind him were quite patient and he does quickly restart so this did not go down as a serious fault i'm sorry,268.08,302.32,323,67,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=268,
while slowing down in second gear anytime you feel the car is starting to jutter you need to change back down to a lower gear so luke needed to put the clutch down and go back into first gear in order to keep going and if you can pull over and park up on the left anywhere safe [Music] sorry about the storm you okay yeah just normally i mean in the other car gear 2's a bit a bit more forgiving but yeah okay you ready to go all right yeah drive up when you're ready,318.0,361.68,467,104,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=318,
[Music] and take the next road on your right [Music],377.45,402.41,52,14,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=377,
at the end of the road turn left at this point luke does not get a minor fault for not checking his mirrors as he is regularly checking his mirrors but just needed to check his mirrors before indicating in case somebody had turned up so [Music] when giving way to traffic like this a signal isn't always necessary but in this case as we're slightly hidden it can be helpful as we moved off from this position the vehicles ahead of us were already giving way and we should have continued but luke goes into this small space on the left creating quite an awkward situation giving him a minor fault for meeting when meeting traffic on small roads like this as well as giving way when safe you also want to be making progress when it's safe to do so,417.919,487.599,745,149,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=417,
and we're going to follow the road ahead i believe that's it whenever you encounter a stop junction it's really important to stop completely when you reach the very end and look really carefully before you emerge out the junction that we're waiting on is hidden from the view of the main road so it's really important to peep and creep until you can see the main road and then emerge to cross the road while emerging out of this stop junction luke's mainly looking towards the right hand side as that's where the immediate danger would be if there was a vehicle approaching but he should have also been looking towards the left hand side if there was a vehicle approaching at full speed he does briefly look with a glance across to the left but the road on the left is on a bend so we can't actually see unless you look fully into the road at the end of this road turn right please [Music] in comparison to the last stop junction this junction is a giveaway as it looks,506.4,570.64,969,195,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=506,
more like a y and we can see both sides of the road really clearly without having to stop so on approach to this junction if you can see the road is clear you can continue without needing to stop the car,572.64,581.519,203,42,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=572,
luke makes good progress while continuing through the road works ahead of us the vehicle on the right is quite large and it is taking up a lot of the road now it's a good idea to brake as you're going through any narrow spaces in case anybody steps into the road from behind the large vehicle [Music] let the roundabout turn right into second exit [Music],606.64,634.34,355,75,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=606,
luke's initially keeping a good clearance from parked vehicles on the left-hand side of the road but as we're going a bit further there are no parked vehicles and luke isn't going into the space on the left and gets too close to oncoming traffic he should have moved over the white line on the left to allow the cars in front more space in the middle of the road all right the roundabouts and right it's the third exit,654.16,680.64,418,89,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=654,
there isn't enough space for us ahead of the crossing while waiting in this position it's a good idea to make sure the left-hand side of the crossing is clear as it's so easy to miss pedestrians due to the windscreen pillar on the left-hand side as the park entrance is really close to the edge,701.6,714.32,294,62,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=701,
[Music],729.78,729.78,7,3,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=729,
i think when it's safe to do so i'd like you to demonstrate how you would wash the rear windscreen thank you now the second set of traffic lights we're going to turn left at the second step turning left [Music],784.639,819.73,210,47,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=784,
a new 40 miles per hour speed starts at this point as we're joining this slip road luke gets up to about 30 miles per hour as he hasn't realized the speed has changed as we're getting to the end of the slip road the traffic on the main road is quite busy and they're not exactly up to 40 miles per hour either so the progress wasn't an issue as we're going to the end luke needed to adjust his speed either by going a bit faster or by going a bit slower there was a vehicle to the right but he dealt with it safely so this didn't go down as a fault [Music] as it's 40 miles per hour even if you've missed the first speed sign you will see signs throughout the road as a reminder the signs are on the lamppost on the left hand side of the road and sometimes on the right luke misses quite a few before he realizes speed is 40.,842.24,898.8,825,192,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=842,
[Music],914.63,914.63,7,3,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=914,
the traffic on the dual carriageway is quite light so nobody's really having to go out of their way to overtake and then switch back into the lane in front of us there's also a slip road coming back in as we go down this bridge so usually traffic moves into the middle lane to allow traffic from the slip road to enter so it's currently not a serious fault with progress,929.92,945.92,370,79,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=929,
luke continues driving at 30 miles per hour on this open road now traffic from behind us is going round into the middle lane and switching back into the left ahead of us so this does go down as a serious fault i'm actually not sure what the speed limit all right we're going to be taking this exit when we get to the roundabout i'd like you to go left it's the first exit the sign on the left hand side shows there's traffic merging from the left as we go forward the traffic on the left have a clear giveaway sign so they need to give way to the traffic approaching from our lane we needed to adjust our speed as the traffic in the distance was slow moving but luke ends up breaking quite abruptly as he thought he had to give way to the traffic [Music] i think we had priority [Music],976.32,1072.31,786,169,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=976,
all right when we get to the next roundabout we're going to be going ahead it's the second exit sign posted towards heathrow our exit is positioned at 10 o'clock which means we need to start in the left-hand lane for an easier exit the diagram has quite a thick line for our exit as well as a green background which means we're heading onto an a road most likely a dual carriageway [Music] okay as we enter the roundabout luke moves in too far towards the left as if he's taking the first exit this position can be quite confusing for traffic behind him so he gets a minor fault for control and steering at this point [Music] so coming up to the next roundabout i'd like you to turn right there exit please traveling at 40 miles per hour when you can see the warning signs that the roundabout is approaching it's a good idea to switch lanes in good time luke does have a really good approach,1134.48,1251.76,891,195,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=1134,
when it comes to roundabouts he positions in good time and slows down controlling the speed of the vehicle and then switches back into a more appropriate gear so that he can deal with the roundabout more easily [Music],1253.12,1269.85,218,43,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=1253,
sorry as we're going round the roundabout ahead of us is now the second exit at this point you simply need to check your mirrors and spiral outwards into the outside lane to exit more easily,1286.4,1308.48,190,39,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=1286,
all right if you could put it in park up on the left just behind the black car but leave enough space in front and don't worry about the driveways on this occasion okay that's great thank you all right what we're going to do now is i'd like you to use the vehicle head to carry out the parallel park exercise so start alongside the vehicle in the road then reverse back and finish within two car lengths and try not to touch the pavement so think of the low curve yeah as a high cap okay and better yet if you want if it's hard with the car on the right next to you you can use the vehicle ahead is one of you ready,1329.52,1372.88,615,133,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=1329,
let's use the silver one ahead instead yes yes we use the silver car okay i've done this once before it went okay i mean i got in the right place it was very sketchy,1390.96,1402.159,165,38,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=1390,

let's turn left as we get to the end of this t-junction to turn left luke gets a serious fault for control and steering it is a giveaway junction and he does look both ways but he comes out too fast and gets too close to the park vehicles on the opposite side of the road it would have been a better idea to come in slowly as there are parked vehicles on both sides and there could have been a vehicle approaching or somebody could have been standing in the road [Music] so what i'm going to get you to do now is shortly i'm going to get you to carry out the emergency stop okay so as you're driving down this road i'm going to make sure it's nice and safe and i'm gonna look around i'm gonna give you this signal stop as soon as you get there i'd like you to stop the car as quickly and as safely as possible okay but wait for my signal before you stop the car yeah ready okay,1484.08,1540.24,877,193,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=1484,
okay let's drive off when you're ready okay all right now i understood this parking brake because it's so cool okay i'm not really complicated i get confused very easily by things,1543.2,1555.76,179,36,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=1543,
[Music] so just continue driving normally so we're carrying out the emergency stop just wait for my signal i will make sure it's safe okay okay [Music] just hold this stop sorry [Music] stop drive off when you're ready [Music] all right if you can just um we're gonna pull in and park up behind the blue car all right if you can just pull in park up behind the blue car it doesn't have to be perfect just on that side of the road don't worry about it just slowly rolling all the way forward just keep going forward a bit further yeah just go a little bit further forward that'd be great there thank you secure the clown and switch off the engine okay that's the end of your driving gestures that's the end of your driving test give me a few minutes okay how's the drive uh it took it took a few minutes for me to kind of settle in all right the car and i've stored it a few times but,1573.58,1685.52,883,195,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=1573,
i like i like the car it was quite it wasn't too bad you know it was it was very easy to drive when i say i like the feature where you don't roll back would you say there are any serious faults then i would i would bet that there is there's one somewhere perhaps related to stalling um but in terms of miners probably a fair few just not 15. okay how did you think the tribe was rj it's good yeah at one point we went over the speed limit i was looking at the site and i was like you saw that yeah yeah so unfortunately no it wouldn't be a pass you you are a really good driver roundabouts were really nice like you you knew your roundabouts which is great okay but um you kind of made a few mistakes because you're unfamiliar with the area which happens so i'm going to go over that so i have got i don't know the total right now but i've got quite a few serious faults,1687.84,1747.36,870,195,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=1687,
purely because i'm going to be a little bit more harsh than the examiner would be because i'd rather you learn from these mistakes before your test okay so obvious one that your friends just pointed out use of speed we're on a 30 miles per hour road you're at 35 miles per hour okay um that road where you eventually said to me i don't know the speed limit what was the speed limit it was 40. 40. you were driving 28 30 for a very long time now it wasn't a major fault at first but then we're passing carrying on and then at that point i was like i'm gonna need to ask because yeah this car's gonna i don't wanna speed but i don't wanna you know but yeah how do you know when it's 30 miles per hour that's the thing i use i i have this trick well not a trick that's like you when you see like lampposts yeah i'm supposed to be 30 right yeah,1749.279,1796.799,840,202,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=1749,
so street lamps and no signs 30 miles per hour oh no when there's no signs yeah there was it must have been a sign that said 14. there were plenty we did you see them yeah i guess your coffee so we had quite a few signs along that road that you were missing um now your reverse park i know you said that was probably the second time you've done it it was really good but you could probably could have looked around a bit better okay because at first she looked around but afterwards there was less yeah emergency stop did that feel like an emergency stop it was an emergency just it's just a casual stuff yeah so unfortunately that felt too slow now sometimes the examiner might be nice and say i'm going to get you to do that again okay well i know for next time i'm gonna actually it's yeah what if a child comes running out in front of you do you break lightly no yeah this is when that break needed to come in um but besides that,1797.84,1860.0,933,196,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=1797,
even after the emergency stop where did you look around before moving off um a little peek on these two windows okay i feel like that's what i'm supposed to do right no oh so even if the other mistakes didn't happen the fact that you did not check over your shoulders because you're in the middle of the road yeah that is a major fault in itself okay so some of these things you weren't aware of and besides i just want to focus i just want to kind of um okay so besides i just want to point out any other things that we could probably highlight um meeting situations right at the beginning you know where we were kind of giving way and that was that one point where you nearly got yourself in a bit of an awkward spot is it that bad there was there was a van and there was a car what happened there just stopped in the middle yeah they were giving away already and you kind of just i was kind of just trying to help them out but they were yeah at the same time,1861.76,1916.399,961,200,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=1861,
so we were kind of already committed when you saw them and then there was a small space and they're already giving way and you try to awkwardly fit in so you don't always have to give way on the left do you you can go through the middle as long as if i'm yeah if i have a straight route i should be the one yeah so when it comes to meeting situations just think about where all the space available is don't just think where's the space on the left and that's what most new drivers do at first they'll always look to kind of get out the road it's more it's more like is there something in front of me yeah is there space on the right where they can potentially go in yeah it's about just being able to resolve the situation rather than just trying to get through every time just trying it sorry it's about trying to resolve it rather than just trying to get out the way and give way give way sometimes that might be creating more,1918.48,1964.72,928,197,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=1918,
havoc than anything yeah yeah the the stall at the very beginning where we stalled turning into that left turn it wasn't a major fault because the person behind they were quite patient and and you recovered but i would suggest try and recover a bit quicker okay yeah yeah every car is different that's why you struggled a little bit with second on that one all right well that's the end of your mock test how was the mock test experience for you i loved it um it's good to know what what i'm struggling at the moment i mean it looks like it's mostly like observation rather than well i still would bet i'm gonna go over these points with you anyways there was one more thing that i forgot to mention it was the slip road entry do you remember we had to join that road i think i'm not sure i think i think i might have it might be better if i had just committed to the yeah the gap before the white car yeah yeah he was given way but,1966.799,2021.2,932,196,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=1966,
this is where you didn't realize it was like 40 miles per hour and you were coming in at 30 so now we're at a difference of 10 and so when he was giving way he has to now slow down so he eventually moved over that's what i felt i felt a bit like he was he was coming at me you know he it was it was nearly going into a serious fault at that point because you're running out of road i was halfway on the road yeah and he's he's they're trying to deal with you but then obviously you're now too slow also so there's a few things there but this i feel like most of these have most of these things here have happened purely because you're new to the area and this is completely different from what you've been doing back in swindon yeah so some of these faults we could take it away for that yeah yeah it's quite promising for the actual that you know it's just mostly about knowing the area,2023.44,2070.96,887,199,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=2023,
so knowing the area definitely helps but yeah all right well that's the end of the mock test from us today hopefully that video has been insightful for you guys and good luck with your test so uh you'll be fine on your test because you know the area but i think some of these things that maybe you didn't realize was the response before yeah especially with the emergency stop yeah have you never done that before no well there you go then that explains be honest yeah if i knew if i knew i had to just just floor it it's kind of in the name but it's okay all right okay um well thank you for everyone that's watching and bye [Music],2072.639,2109.63,633,133,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=2072,

yeah i need to get into the zone hi guys welcome back to clearview driving my name is aman and today i'm doing a mock test with emily we are so we've done lessons from a complete beginner um emily some lessons with me from a complete beginner and you've done around 22 hours we said and your test is in about six weeks but we've um today's our first mock test but she is having a break for a little while so we're gonna see how how she kind of does today and then [Laughter] if we need to but i don't think that'll be the case we've done quite an extensive amount of driving we've done loads of different areas yeah definitely and it's quite busy this morning so be careful because the schools have just started now before we get started um do you want me to tell you a little bit about what the test will be like so i'm going to get you to follow the,34.559,88.4,851,191,_BeI7I_Vxb8,1732,https://youtu.be/_BeI7I_Vxb8?t=34,
stand there for about 15-20 minutes we'll start that a little bit later okay i'm going to give you instructions throughout so whatever i need you to turn i will tell you we're going to do one maneuver and we may also carry out the emergency system now before we get started i'm going to ask you a quick question could you tell me how do you check that your brake lights are working you ask somebody to get out of the car and break and then or no break and look in the reflections okay that's fine it's okay that's okay all right okay so for anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe if you've not already we're going to get straight into it i'm going to give you instructions at first and then satlab will come in a bit later okay okay okay whenever you're ready let's start and drive off when you're ready oh let's try again so at the roundabout turn right is the second exit,89.84,163.76,931,201,_BeI7I_Vxb8,1732,https://youtu.be/_BeI7I_Vxb8?t=89,

i can see it i was just like where is this one right there they think i'm turning when driving along on a road like this with lots of park vehicles we're having to move left and right to accommodate for oncoming traffic so emily needs to be checking her mirrors regularly now nobody is behind trying to overtake so this doesn't go down as a fault at the roundabout and left is the first exit um at this point emily should have checked her mirrors to the right before moving off because it's very easy to miss motorbikes that may try and overtake you here,188.64,248.56,554,118,_BeI7I_Vxb8,1732,https://youtu.be/_BeI7I_Vxb8?t=188,

so whenever i need you to turn i will tell you [Music] always remember to step off the accelerator when going downhill you may even need to use the foot brake to control the speed of the vehicle and if you can just pull in and park up on the left just ahead of this car on the single yellow line is okay on this occasion just in that space is there again i shouldn't block that thing right that's great thank you so i'm going to get you to follow the sat nav so he's not going alone sorry okay so we're gonna start the independent part of the driving test now so i'd like you to follow the satna for the next 15-20 minutes or so okay okay drive off and if you're ready oh,404.4,486.479,671,150,_BeI7I_Vxb8,1732,https://youtu.be/_BeI7I_Vxb8?t=404,
the road ahead is quite narrow and we have parked vehicles on our side of the road there was a vehicle approaching ahead and they do have priority at this point so emily should have waited for them we should not be forcing oncoming traffic to have to stop for us at this point as their side of the road is clear with the bus approaching emily gets a serious fault,502.0,525.6,363,74,_BeI7I_Vxb8,1732,https://youtu.be/_BeI7I_Vxb8?t=502,
this goes down as a serious fault as we did force the bus to have to stop emily looks all around and handles the situation by reversing quickly out of the buses path but emily gets another serious fault while trying to move off she had the car in first gear but didn't lift the clutch high enough and the car was rolling back so the vehicle behind had to use their horn i don't know what to do just bring the clutch higher or what about my throat don't worry by the way i'll just just check the mirror and move off so continue following the sat nav okay okay turn right v361 as we get to the end of this road emily stops a bit short from the line and then doesn't look over to the right properly by the time she decides to go she couldn't actually see and she was about to move off in front of this white van even the gap she does take in the end there was a vehicle approaching on the right who was turning left into the,540.8,619.36,921,197,_BeI7I_Vxb8,1732,https://youtu.be/_BeI7I_Vxb8?t=540,
junction that were waiting but there's a vehicle directly behind them following them quite closely so it would have been safer to wait for both of the cars and wait for a safer gap overall so we're just following the road ahead from here,620.959,638.399,237,46,_BeI7I_Vxb8,1732,https://youtu.be/_BeI7I_Vxb8?t=620,
there's a parked vehicle on the opposite side of the road although the hazard's not on our side of the road we may be required to stop if oncoming traffic don't wait for us [Music] turn left then turn right,659.92,681.44,206,46,_BeI7I_Vxb8,1732,https://youtu.be/_BeI7I_Vxb8?t=659,
turn right a315 [Music] going into the left fender head there are two lanes emily goes into the overtaking lane once in this position she doesn't maintain good lane discipline if there had been a vehicle on the left this would have been an issue as she was encroaching into their space it's really important to have good lane discipline if there are two lanes going the same way and you've started on the right you need to stick to that lane after 200 yards turn right turn right as we're now on a one-way road you would simply position in the direction you intend to go we're going to be turning right so emily switches into the right hand lane turn right,701.839,785.36,656,139,_BeI7I_Vxb8,1732,https://youtu.be/_BeI7I_Vxb8?t=701,

so [Music] due to the roadworks and the traffic on the right-hand side it wasn't safe to drive up to 30 miles per hour at this point but as the traffic clears up it is safe and emily does make good progress after 300 yards go right on the roundabout and take the second exit b363,863.12,905.6,279,66,_BeI7I_Vxb8,1732,https://youtu.be/_BeI7I_Vxb8?t=863,
go right on the roundabout and take the second exit going into this roundabout to turn right emily gets a dangerous fault and i had to tell her to stop as she was about to move in with a van approaching from the right [Music] oh stop that stop that stop that stop that going after him the van approaching from the right was in the left-hand lane which means they're going to be turning left emily didn't realize this and ends up stopping the vehicle directly behind us break quite sharp go left on the roundabout and take the first exit then take the second right [Music] turn right a4 there are two lanes that turn right onto the a4 and we're currently in the overtaking lane the lane on the left of us also turns right starting in this lane isn't a problem as long as you stay in this lane emily started in this lane but as she's mid turns she switches into the left-hand lane without realizing,923.6,1020.639,896,191,_BeI7I_Vxb8,1732,https://youtu.be/_BeI7I_Vxb8?t=923,

there was a red car in the left-hand lane but they were slightly further back so this wasn't a dangerous fault but if you're going to switch lanes you need to check your mirrors because emily didn't check a mirrors to the left this went down as a serious fault whenever you happen to start in an overtaking lane just make sure you stay in that lane get up to the speed of the road and move back into the left hand lane when it's safe to do so you don't need to move back immediately,1048.079,1071.919,482,104,_BeI7I_Vxb8,1732,https://youtu.be/_BeI7I_Vxb8?t=1048,

like uh-oh yeah okay so again right at the get-go kind of going forward not the end of the world you put it in reverse you looked around great you reversed and you even got into that space great yeah and then what happened i got scared because i feel like i annoyed everyone like yes it was a bit of an inconvenience but you know you handled it you needed to just carry on and go yeah i can do this you kept rolling and then that car's behind now they're hooting you that's where the serious fault came in okay okay i kind of thought it was point of narrator yeah even like going forward with the bus it was just like oh um didn't like it yeah because obviously the road is the bus is right there and i'm like what's she doing i kind of miss charge i thought there was a space maybe okay so that was the bus scenario what about the junction where i had to tell you to stop yeah i don't really know what happened there,1472.799,1531.679,917,196,_BeI7I_Vxb8,1732,https://youtu.be/_BeI7I_Vxb8?t=1472,
so you're at this roundabout you're approaching you're about to turn right you can see a van and you've kind of gone over the giveaway line and i thought she'll stop she'll stop and then i had to tell you to stop yeah yeah so it's a bit dangerous it's very interesting yeah um obviously yeah you understand that i don't need to yeah i don't need to elaborate on that one so we're all good now the last mistake you didn't realize and that you know what funny enough with this route that's the one fault that i kind of expected okay purely because it is a tricky turn so we're making a right turn you know where you stalled next to the petrol station the second floor the second stop so we're coming up to this traffic lights term right and you're in the right hand lane and there are actually two lanes that turn right okay you've gone in the right one which is the overtaking lane which is fine as you've,1534.159,1582.0,904,195,_BeI7I_Vxb8,1732,https://youtu.be/_BeI7I_Vxb8?t=1534,
gone into the turn you've switched back into the left lane okay there was a red car there they weren't like right here or they weren't trying to overtake you but they could have been and you've not checked you've just kind of moved over okay so if you've started in the right-hand lane and you're making the right turn what should you have done stay right stayed right and then switched over later yeah yeah so that's my name yeah that's it follow your lane that was the other one um besides that um we had two stalls yeah i feel like i never you never stole i was just about to say you never stole as soon as we started there's that stall and then the van was giving way and then the other saw when can you do that what's one more store the other store was when you had the other store where you were in the second year trying to move off yeah that was that was bad the reversing on the right was good but i feel like you probably could have,1584.159,1635.2,942,201,_BeI7I_Vxb8,1732,https://youtu.be/_BeI7I_Vxb8?t=1584,
looked over to your right blind spot a bit better okay like initially you went like that kind of yeah but then as you're reversing you're checking here there and there but not there okay now on the right there were no entrances there's no houses exactly because it's a bunch of like hedges there so nobody could really come into the road but what if there was a little entrance okay yeah so you want to be checking both sides when reversing i must say you did handle that reverse quite well with the bus like you really got on with it it's a learning experience yeah how do you guess that so it's it's not that badly you're probably thinking i've made loads of silly mistakes there's a lot there's not a lot of mistakes but you know it's definitely quite fast so that's the end of our mock test video today guys hopefully you can learn from some of emily's mistakes you're welcome guys but you've got time so don't we've got time,1636.48,1693.039,929,197,_BeI7I_Vxb8,1732,https://youtu.be/_BeI7I_Vxb8?t=1636,

while waiting at this Junction to turn right Louis is a little bit cautious as there was a vehicle approaching from the left-hand side and they wanted to turn into the road where we were waiting now they could have gone round the top of the vehicle so it was safer to wait okay there we go,182.64,197.159,289,58,PSa9a8Jp75Y,1759,https://youtu.be/PSa9a8Jp75Y?t=182,
left on the roundabout and take the first exit there are lots of factors to consider when driving in the rain firstly you won't be able to drive at the speed of the road as you normally would so you will be driving a little bit slower you want to make sure you're giving yourself more time when it comes to braking and stopping for things and you also want to maintain a bigger following distance behind traffic the wipers can also be a distraction,216.18,245.04,448,89,PSa9a8Jp75Y,1759,https://youtu.be/PSa9a8Jp75Y?t=216,

thank you and drive up when you're ready foreign a good position but it would have been safer to wait slightly earlier so it's easier to move off especially due to the weather Saturday after 200 years then take the second right turn left then take the second right coming out of this Junction to turn left Louis gets a serious Vault for position normal driving as he goes up to the end he needed to follow the corner round so that in the new road he could stay on the left,280.08,353.28,472,95,PSa9a8Jp75Y,1759,https://youtu.be/PSa9a8Jp75Y?t=280,

when dealing with this meeting situation with the white car Louis needed to go into the space that's parallel to the white car as there's traffic behind us he goes into the first space on the left but doesn't go fully into the space and the white car in front starts flashing their headlights to get his attention he doesn't realize what to do and I had to help him out see nearby we're waiting for you to go into that space there,542.459,574.44,430,88,PSa9a8Jp75Y,1759,https://youtu.be/PSa9a8Jp75Y?t=542,
when driving in this sort of weather try and avoid driving through large bottles of water and if you can't avoid it be sure to slow down the speed of your vehicle and avoid splashing pedestrians you can pull over and park up on the left just behind the black car believe enough space to move away at the end of the road turn right then cross the roundabout and take the second exit,592.019,618.18,381,77,PSa9a8Jp75Y,1759,https://youtu.be/PSa9a8Jp75Y?t=592,

foreign the first round about longest road has got a really open View and we can see it quite clearly Louis deals with it really well by slowing down and scanning The Junction on approach the second roundabout has more of a closed view as everything is closer together but again Louis deals with It Well by slowing down and scanning The Junction well it's really important to always check your mirrors towards the road to make sure that it's safe to move off again as it's really easy to miss any cyclist or motorbikes that may be trying to overtake you thank you cross the roundabout and take the second exit then turn left,664.8,732.18,624,123,PSa9a8Jp75Y,1759,https://youtu.be/PSa9a8Jp75Y?t=664,

when following instructions from a Sat Nav you usually get two audible warnings as we're traveling at 40 miles per hour there's second warnings coming in around 400 yards but if we were traveling slower it usually comes in around 150 to 200 yards depending on your speed after 300 yards go around the roundabout and to go around the roundabout and Louis slows down really what an approach this roundabout and switches straight into second gear to control the speed when,901.8,949.62,469,92,PSa9a8Jp75Y,1759,https://youtu.be/PSa9a8Jp75Y?t=901,

take the exit then keep after 100 yards keep left keep left at the end of the road turn right Louis does signal a bit early on approach to this Junction but we are traveling at a high speed and there are no entrances on the right hand side so the signal wouldn't necessarily be confusing for other drivers turn right foreign,1014.72,1066.98,324,64,PSa9a8Jp75Y,1759,https://youtu.be/PSa9a8Jp75Y?t=1014,

you have reached your destination so that's the end of your independent part of the um driving test I'm going to give you instructions as normal from now that was the independent life stressful it's really different just being in their own second guessing yourself okay now the roundabout like you to follow the road ahead the second exit,1124.22,1152.78,338,63,PSa9a8Jp75Y,1759,https://youtu.be/PSa9a8Jp75Y?t=1124,
pulling and park up on the left along here please leave enough space to move away all right I think you can stop right straight that's right we're gonna continue now so I'm gonna be ready Louis initially misjudged the speed of the vehicle that was approaching but decided not to go as it would not have been safe as well as making sure the road is clear you need to make sure you're watching for hazards all around there's a car that's coming out of a car park on the opposite side of the road and they're waiting for the exact same Gap as us as they're moving into the same direction now Louis manages to deal with the car fairly quickly but this could have been an issue had the car moved in later or moved in at speed let's try again Louis gets a serious fault on approach of the next pedestrian Crossing as there's a pedestrian approaching from the right who steps into the road and Louis wasn't able to stop even though,1194.48,1264.62,924,191,PSa9a8Jp75Y,1759,https://youtu.be/PSa9a8Jp75Y?t=1194,

thank you take the next Road on your left it's just up here this is not a Crossing where you have to give priority and The Pedestrian was simply walking up to the End of the Road to Cross and there was also a van following us quite closely which is why this goes down as a serious form also due to the weather it wasn't actually safe to break like this to pull over and park on the right hand side of the road don't worry about the driveways on this occasion foreign what I'd like you to do now is I'd like you to reverse back for about two comments keeping a reasonable distance from the pavement and try not to touch the curb as you're carrying out this exercise Louis is Thoroughly checking all around as well as checking towards the road and over his left blind spot but he should also be checking over his right blind spot in case somebody steps into the road from the right hand side foreign copyright thank you I'm driving when you're ready,1286.76,1377.0,947,196,PSa9a8Jp75Y,1759,https://youtu.be/PSa9a8Jp75Y?t=1286,

meeting situation we had a few with the big lorry yeah like no you had the right idea didn't you you said I'm gonna wait here yeah and I waited yeah and then I just didn't know what he wanted me to do why did he not go through because there wasn't enough space and so I thought I'd reverse back a bit he was just trying to ask you to go forward but now you waited but you're waiting in your side of the road in the middle of your lane yeah but there's Park cars to your right he definitely couldn't fit okay so we needed to go into that space as if we're fully parking because of the size of that vehicle yeah so you had the right idea but you just didn't move over enough we haven't done um meeting practice around these roads for a while so that's kind of why that propped up but that's okay the roundabout was really good the Dual Carriage was really nice you dealt with everything along there very nicely no trouble,1459.799,1508.88,919,200,PSa9a8Jp75Y,1759,https://youtu.be/PSa9a8Jp75Y?t=1459,
um we had even at the beginning you know when we started here that large vehicle turned up and you kind of went next to him and then you just sat there he had to use the horn to say get on with it I don't know it was the same thing there yeah earlier on when we were driving do you remember when I said you're positioning too far to the right and yeah too much space on your left now that's kind of what was happening with your meeting situations as well yeah so you were just leaving too much space on the left and then the cars in front are having trouble yeah so what we've got to do with those meeting situations is just move into that space earlier okay I can't fault you on your mirrors and stuff like that you were generally really aware of your surroundings which is nice yeah right near the end we had two faults one after the other what happened to that zebra Crossing do you remember the man on the right yeah I know he was literally just in,1510.799,1558.02,952,197,PSa9a8Jp75Y,1759,https://youtu.be/PSa9a8Jp75Y?t=1510,
that blind spot there no what do we do if you can't see gotta lean full wood and there was a car coming as well so it just blocked it it completely did yeah no I didn't want to break on that um at that point because it was a double crossing and he just started on the right sorry it was a single Crossing but he just started on the right and the van behind was a bit close otherwise if it was a bit safer I would have stopped you there okay so it wasn't safe for me to actually put the brakes on at that point yeah but that was definitely serious fault then straight after that point there was that man who approached from the left who then you stopped for do you remember yeah now did you need to stop for him well I thought that'd be safe okay so on that one that's kind of pushing more towards a serious spot because we're stopping where it's not as ever Crossing it's just he wants to cry,1559.76,1604.039,892,190,PSa9a8Jp75Y,1759,https://youtu.be/PSa9a8Jp75Y?t=1559,
he's about to walk out and through it we'll see I know I know he wanted to cross but it wasn't like he was going to walk right in front of you yeah he was kind of popping his head forward to see okay but yeah that's a bit of an annoying one right near the end there okay I'm trying to think if there's any mistakes that I've missed uh so we had one stall because we were in the wrong office yeah but the main concern on that is that a fault in itself it wasn't a major fault no you handled it nobody wasn't like nobody was there when you were trying to move anyways but it was the fact of like you turned left really wide that you're in between the two lanes that was really the major fault the position now I'm trying to think if there's any other major major faults you did really well afterwards kind of moving in and out with all the mini roundabouts and stuff being safe on that it was just the first little bit well,1606.559,1659.419,921,200,PSa9a8Jp75Y,1759,https://youtu.be/PSa9a8Jp75Y?t=1606,
it's caught me by surprise name that just like shook me what the the road marking couldn't see it with the rain and the large Vehicles yeah and I think that just knocked my confidence and then it all sort of fell apart right earlier it was just right at the beginning yeah and then right near the end the two with the Crossing with the pedestrians it was those two those kind of things mainly meeting and um the pedestrians okay so overall it's okay we've got time to fix this yeah you did the roundabout really well you followed your lane really nice I know it was quite difficult with the with the weather couldn't see it couldn't see it at all but you were really aware of your surroundings checking your mirrors following your lanes that was all really good okay oh that's it you'll reverse on the right did you look over your right blind spot uh I thought I did that side you were mean because you had your arm around my seat as well so you're mainly checking around this way which is great,1661.4,1717.74,995,200,PSa9a8Jp75Y,1759,https://youtu.be/PSa9a8Jp75Y?t=1661,
but what if somebody walks out from that side because there were various houses weren't there that's true I thought I did but at the stop yeah but you need to you reverse back for two columns so that's quite a bit Yeah so we should have checked it you're checking more regularly okay okay yeah all right well that's the end of our video today hopefully some of these tips are useful for you guys it is difficult driving in the rain so there's loads of factors to consider like following distance breaking distance Road markings as you can see that's the main issue we had today and the rain actually slowed down by the time we started the mock test before that it was even worse So yeah thank you for watching and bye bye see you next time [Music],1719.72,1757.23,747,151,PSa9a8Jp75Y,1759,https://youtu.be/PSa9a8Jp75Y?t=1719,

hi guys welcome back to Clearview driving my name is Amin and today I'm doing a mock test with my one I'm saying it already Okay so this is the first time we're driving together and you have done the test before yeah I've done two okay and I found them there it's okay but they were quite close together yeah and so today you want to just figure out what's going on and hopefully learn from any mistakes if there are any yeah now we're in a completely new car and what you're used to and a completely new area from where you're generally used to driving yeah you know the area but you don't you've never driven around here not really no okay so I'll be different um yeah you'd know what's involved in a mock test you've seen the videos you know what's a lot okay all right so throughout the drive I'm going to get you to follow the road ahead I'll tell,32.099,79.5,852,187,aqad7PfuzsM,2019,https://youtu.be/aqad7PfuzsM?t=32,
you whenever I need you to turn okay we're gonna do one maneuver we may also do the emergency stop similar to everything you've already been practicing now before we get started I'm going to ask you a quick question okay could you tell me how do you check that your brakes are working in your car so when you press them they shouldn't feel spongy or slack you should feel some resistance okay um and when you drive off your car shouldn't pull to one side that's fine do you do you need the car on to test the brakes no yes yes or no that's just an additional question for you no you have to have it on yeah because we've got hydraulic brakes okay okay all right so we're gonna get started um for anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe if you've not already we're gonna get straight into it [Music] foreign stationary it's always a really good idea to look from the pavement towards,80.939,151.26,939,197,aqad7PfuzsM,2019,https://youtu.be/aqad7PfuzsM?t=80,

it's all good so we're going ahead from here okay Mario observes this Junction really well by looking right ahead left ahead right she's not looking in the sequence exactly but she's looking throughout and then turn right from here marwa demonstrates really good clutch control at this point and looks carefully to make sure the road is clear and then turn off please my room makes this left turn really nicely and in the new road she does initially position in the center but as we're going forward up to the crossroads she starts positioning Too Close towards the left as there are part casts throughout she needed to stay in the middle for a little bit longer going hit initially my wife is still positioned closer towards the left when we should be completely in the center of the road to leave enough space on both sides but after the motorbike that's coming towards us has passed she does send to the car quite nicely at the end turn right [Music] Motorway uses really good clutch control,193.98,306.54,994,191,aqad7PfuzsM,2019,https://youtu.be/aqad7PfuzsM?t=193,
to Peep and creep out into the new road when she notices there's a vehicle approaching she waits in this position so we're now over the giveaway line and we are in the new road and the traffic has started to flow it's not an issue that we're in this position as we didn't move in front of traffic we moved out when the road was clear now from this position you simply wait for the road to be clear or if someone on the main road gives way to you you can slowly Peep and creep to continue out,308.46,331.44,491,107,aqad7PfuzsM,2019,https://youtu.be/aqad7PfuzsM?t=308,
coming up to this next parked car on the left hand side which is quite close to the island with the zebra crossing my ride does really well to stop in a good position behind the car and also uses her mirrors before moving off from this position if the Space is really tight be sure to use really tight clutch control and get yourself out from behind the park car so that you don't travel any closer,351.78,369.9,398,80,aqad7PfuzsM,2019,https://youtu.be/aqad7PfuzsM?t=351,
[Music] coming up to the end of this road there is a compulsory left turn which you can see by the arrow painted on the floor and on the sign on the left hand side of the road coming up to a junction like this The Examiner would not tell you that you have to turn left as you can see this very clearly and it's a good idea to use your signals as your signal could be beneficial for pedestrians or cyclists as the traffic on the new road is moving quite slowly they tend to give way so be sure when you're waiting at a junction like this to get eye contact with the traffic on the main road and if they're waiting for you quite clearly then you should slowly Edge forward there was a van on the right hand side that was flashing their headlights to give Mo away and it wasn't very clear that he's giving away so this does not go down as a fault make sure you know the traffic is definitely waiting for you before you commit to the Gap good,386.41,442.02,938,196,aqad7PfuzsM,2019,https://youtu.be/aqad7PfuzsM?t=386,

as we moved off from this position modua gets a serious fault with use of mirrors change direction she should have carried on in the left lane but she moves into the middle Lane and there was a car right next to her she does check her in there is but she should not have moved over [Music] foreign [Music] traffic lights there were three lanes as we go forward it continues as three lanes for a little while then lane two and three come together to merge to become the overtaking lane we later had to move back into the left-hand Lane which marwa does really well,485.819,537.18,563,116,aqad7PfuzsM,2019,https://youtu.be/aqad7PfuzsM?t=485,
initially marwa is a little slow while making progress but she does quickly get up to the speed of the road and she's not holding anybody up so this does not go down as a fault okay we're going to take the next turning on your left the next Justin here okay turning left in here while turning left into this new road marwa is holding the clutch down but she's controlling the speed by breaking enough and she's in the correct gear she simply needed to just let go of the clutch which she does as soon as she's in the new road so this isn't necessarily going to be a fault as her speed was controlled the whole time [Music],552.36,612.0,622,133,aqad7PfuzsM,2019,https://youtu.be/aqad7PfuzsM?t=552,

planning as she's trying to keep the entrance on the left hand side clear but then she decided to go forward and ends up stopping too close to the van because she's again trying to keep the entrance clear behind her you should always aim to leave tires and tarmac visible when you're stopping as we're traveling in slow-moving traffic manual was about to go into second gear and she puts her clutch down but then she decided against the gear change and brings the clutch back up and first gear which results in the car engine braking and the car ends up jolting now this can be serious fault if somebody behind is too close and you bring the clutch up really quickly as they won't realize you're slowing down as there's no brake light when the engine brake engages so if you have put the clutch down be sure to bring the clutch up slowly so that the engine brake doesn't kick in suddenly now at the traffic lights we're going to,695.72,751.019,928,188,aqad7PfuzsM,2019,https://youtu.be/aqad7PfuzsM?t=695,

and then turn right just in here I remember what I'd like you to do now is to reverse into a space of your choice you can use one of these spaces or you can use these places on the left also to park in either side but reverse into a space as soon as you get into a car park it's a really good idea to go into reverse gear straight away so if someone turns up behind you they know what you're intending to do Mario wait's in the middle of the road for some time but nobody turned in behind us so this wasn't at fault but you need to make it clear with using your reverse light as a signal or even using your indicators,928.68,974.76,617,134,aqad7PfuzsM,2019,https://youtu.be/aqad7PfuzsM?t=928,

let the traffic lights turn left [Music] these traffic lights had a filter error for turning left which goes green before the rest of the traffic light so we were able to turn but the bus had to wait the traffic light ahead where The Pedestrian is waiting to cross does not have a solid line going across our path so if that traffic light had been red we would not have stopped in that position as that was a repeat traffic light [Music] okay well it's safe to do so I'd like you to demonstrate how you would de-list the front windscreen thank you you can turn it off okay come up to a roundabout now I'd like you to take the fourth exit right it's kind of like third eggs actually so third exit right as we enter the roundabout at this point marlaw gets a serious fault with Junction observation as the Lorry on the right was approaching quite fast and we should not have moved in front of them we're now passing the penultimate exit,1131.48,1244.64,934,197,aqad7PfuzsM,2019,https://youtu.be/aqad7PfuzsM?t=1131,
and Mara should have been checking her mirrors and moving into the left to take the exit but she stays on the right and exits from the right which can be dangerous next round about we're going to go ahead to Dabi Road [Music] the Lorry waiting on the right hand side has got a left indicator meaning they're going to be turning left and we did not need to wait for them so there are quite a few chances that marua has missed at this point [Music] as we were waiting to enter the roundabout the traffic coming up behind us had to keep switching into the right hand lane in order to avoid us which is why it went down as a serious fault for hesitation and as marwa entered the roundabout she needed to go round the roundabout staying in the outskirts as we started in the left-hand Lane no don't go in the bus lane when we get to the very end of this road I'd like you to turn right [Music],1246.5,1344.37,888,194,aqad7PfuzsM,2019,https://youtu.be/aqad7PfuzsM?t=1246,

was next to me yeah and you moved in front of them didn't you yeah and then we had to move back to the left later yeah so you actually switched Lanes there yeah I switched Lanes like as we got on yeah because I thought we always we have to be on the left if we're not overtaking no true but when you started at those traffic lights which lane were you in the the there was only two lanes right there were three there were three I was in the middle you were on the left I'll show you later so that was the first bit obviously that's a mistake because you've just switched over Lanes the guy's having to blast the horn even the Lorry is using the hall at that point yeah yeah I was quite a bit of a weird one because nothing's really going on and you've just you've just drifted over okay yeah besides that I want to talk about your roundabouts because that's where the trouble seems to be for me me too firstly a bit of hesitation you,1613.52,1662.36,933,203,aqad7PfuzsM,2019,https://youtu.be/aqad7PfuzsM?t=1613,
don't really realize when to go yeah or two separate accounts we just sat there that Lorry which we will see indicating not the way I was going yeah and we just sat there and about three full cars had gone past you and you're right thankfully no one was behind you so no one's disturbed because they're all going around you yeah and you're looking at that Lorry and you're like yeah but then did you see the red car yeah but that red car you know I thought the red car was gonna come around yeah but it did it actually started next to you you both started the roundabout together he went into the roundabout did a u-10 and come back out really yeah um then we had the the massive black Lorry I think it was like a John Lewis or something as we went in he was right there so we needed to the roundabout was a bit tricky because yeah so you needed to once you go in you got to get on with it Go a bit clean,1664.159,1713.9,904,199,aqad7PfuzsM,2019,https://youtu.be/aqad7PfuzsM?t=1664,
really quick like he did I think I feel like I had time in the beginning and then he just he just yeah you tried to pick up speed but we needed to be a bit quicker there so we firstly because of how that roundabout is it's kind of like this you can't really see so you want to lean forward and when you go in you gotta go yeah yeah um and mostly it's to do with how you're exiting the roundabouts you're not trying to make your way to the left to the exit you're kind of just slipping off the roundabout from the right and that's where um you're kind of making it harder for yourself it's not so safe the way we're leaving roundabouts I'm gonna go over that with you now your reverse park into the bay really nice but um you know when before you started before you picked that space you know there was a car in that space yeah like a woman there was a silver,1715.4,1761.84,858,190,aqad7PfuzsM,2019,https://youtu.be/aqad7PfuzsM?t=1715,
color then she moved did she not because I was waiting and then I didn't know well I wanted you wanted that exact space and you want her to remember that was quite funny because you lined up with the line and I thought great and I thought well there's a car in that space you put it in reverse skin and she happened to move yeah another thing what's gonna happen okay so you went into the space perfectly and you're looking around it's all great you know when we was outside Asda yeah we was turning left yeah because the arrow on the floor said left I didn't know I did and you I did it yeah that was fine but like do you have to do it then it's a good idea isn't it because if you what if you were crossing the road on the main road and you're just kind of looking up and down you don't see any cars on the main road and you don't realize the traffic coming from Asda is going to come this way so as a,1763.82,1808.1,903,200,aqad7PfuzsM,2019,https://youtu.be/aqad7PfuzsM?t=1763,
pedestrian that signal would be useful for them yeah so that's why that's why you want to just put your signal on every time you're turning so mostly just hesitation um and you're changing lanes on your roundabouts yeah there was one where was this sorry let me think about there was one where you oh yes that's it we were going we were going how did I miss to forget to say this so we're you know that roundabout where that Laurie was on your right and you were waiting for ages hesitation yeah when you went into that roundabout initially you've started the roundabout in the left lane as you enter the roundabout you've drawn a straight line across the two lanes and then head back out so I wasn't like in against Lane discipline yeah I was just in the middle of two days so you started in the left one these both need to go in and go like that it started on the left and then you end up I'm gonna go in the right one and,1809.96,1859.58,924,199,aqad7PfuzsM,2019,https://youtu.be/aqad7PfuzsM?t=1809,
then I'm gonna exit on the left one oh so you're kind of drawing a straight path between these two lanes your General Drive is really good like you're using your mirror signaling positioning your clutch control your observation at small Junctions that's all really good hesitation on roundabouts for sure you don't realize when to go in yeah and um when you're leaving when you're you're Lane discipline on the roundabout itself and when you need to move left so we're going to go and practice some of this now so you can see it yeah yeah that's what I kind of thought as well I haven't really done much roundabout you haven't um I've done a few but like not big ones like I've done the the small ones but I haven't really like practiced a lot on them on the big ones yeah um I could kind of tell yeah you kind of um you weren't that confident on them because what you have to do in roundabouts is even though you've,1861.02,1910.52,916,197,aqad7PfuzsM,2019,https://youtu.be/aqad7PfuzsM?t=1861,
started on the right when you when you know you're going you're going to be exiting and you can go yep that's one that's two if you're leaving at three let's say you're going around the roundabout you go well that's one that's two as soon as you can see two you don't want to be in the right lane and you want to start to you want to start to move outwards so check your mirrors move out signaling yeah whereas what you're doing is you're going oh there's one two and then you're going around then all this through and then you just I'm just cutting like I'm not actually yeah yeah so if you had like on this you know when we did this round about U-turn that motorbike he was about to enter as you were going around because he thought oh she's on the right still so she's probably gonna go around yeah yeah all right well that's the end of the mock test today how was this mock test,1911.84,1953.059,882,199,aqad7PfuzsM,2019,https://youtu.be/aqad7PfuzsM?t=1911,
experience for you do you think it was okay I've kind of like clarified that I really do need to focus on like roundabouts and my leans because I I do think my general driving is quite decent you've got good control of your car like it's okay it's just when it comes to like round the box and stuff like that roundabouts in Lane discipline you said it at the beginning yeah yeah I knew it so it's good you know what to work on but you just need to really kind of focus on these things now yeah you want to be really confident around about something that's it if you want to be really confident know what you're doing have your exit planned okay all right well thank you for everyone that's been watching hopefully you can learn from motherwell's mistakes here and not make them but yeah that's okay you'd rather make these mistakes now in your lessons still yeah because you don't want to get your license and then head out and drive again yeah exactly,1956.059,2007.36,952,196,aqad7PfuzsM,2019,https://youtu.be/aqad7PfuzsM?t=1956,

yeah I mean yeah I feel like I feel like I've got this in the bag okay we'll see how do you think you'll do I have to do just fine yeah yeah okay we've got we've got some good good places okay so um the main criteria today is to just see how you're driving I want to see if you were to do your driving test again would you pass would you fail okay and that's what we're gonna I'm gonna find out okay has things changed though because when I did my driving test everything was kind of different kind of I think was it yeah as long as you're a safe driver on the road of course how you're driving it's about what you're doing on the roads and how you're dealing with situations okay that's fine I'm not going to give you any more hints and tips it's all done okay so we're gonna do one maneuver and we may also do the emergency stop gonna go through a mixture of things all right so we're gonna get straight,78.9,130.459,905,203,Nbv14FCelSM,1895,https://youtu.be/Nbv14FCelSM?t=78,
into it then before we get started I am going to ask you a quick question I hate these okay all right how do you check if your anti-lock brake how would you know if there was an issue with your anti-lock braking system how would you know if there was an issue with your anti-lock braking system uh so anti-lock yeah okay uh you've got to press the pedal down yeah and see if it's hard so you'd have to test it to know if there's an issue with it yeah so like just press it down I guess isn't it okay these questions put me under pressure all right so when you're ready let's start the engine foreign over the head move might be a bit stiff but we'll still get it done okay we're going straight on yeah just drive off in a straight line okay is it isn't it the new like driving because you've got to follow like a navigation now I'm gonna give you some independent driving through this is all yeah,132.42,193.379,896,194,Nbv14FCelSM,1895,https://youtu.be/Nbv14FCelSM?t=132,
everything is step by step during the test come down [Music] I'm just starting it's already been there I did [Music] Jeremy does have a bit of a bad habit of coasting where he rests his left foot over on the clutch and puts it down unnecessarily this can cause you to gain momentum going into turns,197.12,252.36,298,64,Nbv14FCelSM,1895,https://youtu.be/Nbv14FCelSM?t=197,

it's a 20 zone is it I thought I saw a 40 on the floor we're gonna follow it around to the right and then have the traffic lights turn right so right from here and then traffic lights right traffic light right what's he doing see this guy traffic like right that's on the right,1039.079,1082.52,277,62,Nbv14FCelSM,1895,https://youtu.be/Nbv14FCelSM?t=1039,

driving along this road we're currently driving in the overtaking lane which is the Middle Lane we should only be in this position if we're overtaking slower moving traffic on the left Jeremy gets a serious fault for this foreign in the distance Jeremy's following this white card too closely we should have been trying to maintain at least a two second following distance I had to tell him to back off as it was starting to become dangerous,1116.059,1142.58,441,85,Nbv14FCelSM,1895,https://youtu.be/Nbv14FCelSM?t=1116,
all right so we're going to be taking this exit just coming off this one the next one coming off,1161.539,1165.08,96,21,Nbv14FCelSM,1895,https://youtu.be/Nbv14FCelSM?t=1161,
and then when we get to the roundabout we're going to turn right into the second exit and turn right to turn right to turn right second exit we can use the middle or the far right lane Jeremy starts in the overtaking lane to begin the roundabout now he's an experienced driver with a full driving license but during your driving test if you find yourself in this position where you're struggling to switch lanes it's safer to just go around the roundabout and take a different exit Jeremy just about manages to leave the roundabout safely as the vehicle that was next to him switched over to the far left lane but this could have very easily gone down as a serious law in a driving test much purchasing no it's okay we'll just make a left in here oh stop that sorry oh stop that sorry oh we had time to stop don't speed through it okay yeah God damn it man I was about to fly I wasn't expecting that orange traffic lights that have been,1181.4,1266.299,936,193,Nbv14FCelSM,1895,https://youtu.be/Nbv14FCelSM?t=1181,
green for a while there's a chance okay good damn maybe that's a that's a serious one why are you not wearing a seatbelt I don't know I didn't know he wasn't wearing his people I don't see that Hollywood you know yeah apparently I heard the speedometer is actually wired to like make a good like show it's faster than you actually yeah so if you're doing like 22 miles per hour you're actually doing that should I always deduct two from the speed you're doing yeah so what about the time you went 25 do you remember that quick question Jeremy what's the speed limit right now miles per hour I saw the 20 on the floor it has to be 20 miles per hour don't tell me 30. and that's 20. do you see any signs I don't see any signs that's what I'm saying also didn't start that automatically becomes dirty right see that I uh all right so we've got two roundabouts,1268.22,1361.76,856,197,Nbv14FCelSM,1895,https://youtu.be/Nbv14FCelSM?t=1268,
now one after the other okay we're gonna go straight from both of them all right that's okay these ones are right next to each other this is a double stepper Crossing and The Pedestrian had just started on the right hand side of the road so it was safe for us to continue straight straight second dad said my dad said it's straight a second surely [Music] second Road on your left just when that Porsche went the second left as the two roads are really close together Jeremy should have checked his mirrors slowed down but signaled after the first road has passed this signal could have been very dangerous as there was a car waiting in the first Junction,1363.5,1439.22,655,129,Nbv14FCelSM,1895,https://youtu.be/Nbv14FCelSM?t=1363,
okay Jeremy what I'm going to get you to do now is shortly I'm going to ask you to carry out the emergency stop yes I've been preparing all my life for this so as you're driving down this road I'm gonna make sure the road is nice and safe and I'm going to give you this signal okay stop yep I'm gonna make sure that no one's behind so wait for my signal before you carry out the stop okay okay now okay drive up when you're ready I can't get no money so why what's up because okay,1455.179,1490.46,480,112,Nbv14FCelSM,1895,https://youtu.be/Nbv14FCelSM?t=1455,
stop okay thank you I'm not gonna ask you to do that again drive off when you're ready let's turn left in here please oh so we're going to be looking for a place to pull over and park along the left hand side if there is one I join me to pick where I want yeah so hopefully if there's a bit of space right there yeah that'd be great there for the red car [Music] it's great there thank you foreign front I'd like you to demonstrate how you would carry out the parallel park exercise okay so pull up alongside the vehicle in the road then reverse back and finish within two car lens and try not to touch the pavement as you carry out the exercise yeah,1508.88,1565.159,650,141,Nbv14FCelSM,1895,https://youtu.be/Nbv14FCelSM?t=1508,
that's great there thank you all right thank you secure the car and switch off the engine please all right so how was your drive today yeah go ahead relax how's my drive today yeah I mean how many shall be generous or shall I give you would you say there were any serious faults would I say that was a serious fault um I think when enough with that orange light okay that might that might be a serious thought but I thought I had enough time I I struggle with speed right sometimes it creeps up but I live by the 10 simple so yeah that did creep up quite a few times on the 20 zones you're kind of driving 25 at times there's a few occasions and you kind of hit the bricks I did and you're following distance from other cars okay not good well you like you said two car lots sometimes we didn't even have that oh wow and he looked like I was pushing him on he was going a bit,1590.539,1647.72,875,189,Nbv14FCelSM,1895,https://youtu.be/Nbv14FCelSM?t=1590,
no but generally that's not a good idea okay all right okay because especially when we had that car with the tinted windows the black Mercedes couldn't see anything quite a large car what's what's going on in front what if he was slam on the brakes okay yeah then that's yeah I'm gonna end good so that um we were just making a left hand back here and I said to you take the second Road on your left didn't I yeah now did you notice that silver car waiting on that first road yeah what did you do with your signal I'll put it on just went past him yeah I was supposed to let him go no but you should have signaled after the first road what if she know what if she thinks you're turning into the first road oh yeah okay that makes sense yeah because they were so close together yeah okay well I beat you so that signal timing should have been later yeah um emergency stop how was it it's very good yeah the emergency stop was good good yeah but I didn't observe my,1648.919,1704.659,963,205,Nbv14FCelSM,1895,https://youtu.be/Nbv14FCelSM?t=1648,
surroundings before did I beat myself up did you notice that I know it's this you also realized yeah what about this this maneuver here how's it I mean perfect I reckon all right okay um control wise I can't fault you you did do the maneuver very nicely within the criteria but did you at any point look around did you check your blind spots oh yeah you remember when I was like this you crack my head open was before moving off or before starting in the road at what point did you look around okay no I don't think I looked around then um I had a good idea there was no one around unfortunately that alone would be a serious fault in itself Oh serious I lost count of how many serious thoughts we had there no way and I'm not just joking around okay so there's quite a few areas I think we need to have a do-over at some point in the future and hopefully after watching yourself driving you can maybe pick up on little things and what you need to,1708.2,1767.0,947,197,Nbv14FCelSM,1895,https://youtu.be/Nbv14FCelSM?t=1708,
improve on okay and hopefully learn from this oh yeah yeah but oh God no no it's definitely not a pass Oh my days I lost count I wasn't even writing it down because there were so many many yeah I know someone happy would have noticed that contract okay the thing is right the mistakes you're making any experienced driver would do the same thing okay you're kind of just getting on with what you're doing you're just trying to look ahead and just kind of get on with the drive 20 22 this month 25 doesn't matter okay so all right okay fine I'm I'm acting like an experienced driver yeah and so that's why you're making these mistakes you're kind of okay did you have a good experience whilst I was driving we managed to drive around without scraping the car yeah great exactly so that's a pass right that's a that's definitely a pause there are a few hearing moments but yeah you could definitely uh brush up on your driving skills a little bit okay all,1769.279,1834.5,953,200,Nbv14FCelSM,1895,https://youtu.be/Nbv14FCelSM?t=1769,

steering because I did it and then I went on the left side oh God okay it's a really bad old car then it was it's a 2010 Volkswagen Astra so okay it's not that bad all right it's good for upgrades Okay so it started I'd like you to move off one of you already all right um oh okay yeah that makes sense all right,236.819,271.979,312,76,7ttnVx9fCIA,1885,https://youtu.be/7ttnVx9fCIA?t=236,
about [Music] oh wait as the roads around here are fairly wide and there aren't a lot of parked Vehicles it's fairly easy to go through the roundabouts without slowing down as they have an open View and if you can put over on Park up on the left somewhere safe [Music] thank you forever gonna be ready [Music] all right the roundabout I'd like you to turn right please it's the second exit,288.54,364.38,389,86,7ttnVx9fCIA,1885,https://youtu.be/7ttnVx9fCIA?t=288,
an approach to this next Crossroads we're approaching from a side road Louis stuff starts to slow down but stops over the giveaway line now this would have gone down as a serious fault had a vehicle been approaching on the main road so it's really important to slow down and stop before the giveaway line sorry I have the choice [Music],385.259,413.95,336,67,7ttnVx9fCIA,1885,https://youtu.be/7ttnVx9fCIA?t=385,
on approach to this next Junction there's a compulsory left turn with an arrow painted on the floor and signs on either side so an approach to a junction like this The Examiner will not give you instructions so did you say left here right we're just following the roads coming out of this left turn Lewis gets two serious faults the first one when he gets to the end he stops over the giveaway line causing a vehicle in Lane one to Swerve into lane two to avoid us then when trying to move off his stalls causing a lorry on the main road to give way as he moves off from this position he then swings into lane two causing a vehicle in the second lane to slow down for us [Music],439.62,478.34,678,140,7ttnVx9fCIA,1885,https://youtu.be/7ttnVx9fCIA?t=439,
oh crap did I hit the cup no no come on [Music],496.139,512.19,47,14,7ttnVx9fCIA,1885,https://youtu.be/7ttnVx9fCIA?t=496,
sorry what did I hit that you didn't I didn't hear anything oh it's a diesel car when it stools oh that was just okay okay I really thought I hit something the sign on the left hand side shows that the two lanes are merging into one in the distance Lewis is initially checking his mirrors at first but he should have also checked closer to the end the black car on the right hand side does merge in behind us so this doesn't go down as a fault but you should always merge and turn and check your mirrors oh crap,540.6,574.62,511,107,7ttnVx9fCIA,1885,https://youtu.be/7ttnVx9fCIA?t=540,
[Music] the traffic light Junction turned right [Music] oh God [Music],589.86,617.85,70,17,7ttnVx9fCIA,1885,https://youtu.be/7ttnVx9fCIA?t=589,
what about the traffic lights turn left [Music] although there are no Junctions on the left hand side before the traffic lights the signal is timed too early as we're traveling at 20 miles per hour we should have signaled when we're a little bit closer [Music],682.26,700.99,260,55,7ttnVx9fCIA,1885,https://youtu.be/7ttnVx9fCIA?t=682,
in the distance Lewis gets a dangerous fault for control with meeting the road is fairly narrow and there are parked vehicles on the right hand side of the road although we do have priority the vehicle ahead was already committed and we should have given weight I had to take control stop it sorry I break because your left eye is about to hit the paper now yeah I saw sorry I break because your left eye is not to hit the paper stop back sorry I break because your left hand is about to hit the paper yeah I should have stopped there [Music] we're gonna go straight this roundabout okay [Music] all right and at the roundabout turn right it's the third exit [Music],720.48,791.92,666,137,7ttnVx9fCIA,1885,https://youtu.be/7ttnVx9fCIA?t=720,
always try and allow more clearance around your vehicle ideally try and aim to have at least one meter of clearance from the left and right and at least two car lengths in front and behind creating this safety bubble if you feel like the spacer head is smaller then you need to reduce the speed so the smaller the space the slower you go,809.399,825.959,337,65,7ttnVx9fCIA,1885,https://youtu.be/7ttnVx9fCIA?t=809,
if you can pull it and park up on the left somewhere safe [Music] thank you ready while waiting to move off Lewis is regularly checking his mirrors and his blind spot it's always really important to check towards the right just before you move off if you happen to wait for some cars be sure to check again Lewis does have a bit of a habit of mainly using his right hand on the steering wheel and occasionally bringing his left hand in now as long as you don't actually lose control of the steering this will not go down as a fault but as good practice you should use both hands on the steering wheel but your right hand will be dominant [Music] all right the traffic light Junction turn right please [Music],874.8,936.27,708,143,7ttnVx9fCIA,1885,https://youtu.be/7ttnVx9fCIA?t=874,
oh when waiting in a yellow box Junction like this always keep waiting until you can see the road ahead to be safe or until the traffic lights are ahead of you to go red whichever comes first,981.3,997.019,191,38,7ttnVx9fCIA,1885,https://youtu.be/7ttnVx9fCIA?t=981,

we're now going on to a 40 miles per hour dual carriageway when traveling uphill it's really important to use lower gears and use more acceleration to get up to the speed quicker when you switch into a higher gear you will lose more power making it harder to actually speed up we were now traveling 30 miles per hour on this 40 miles per hour dual carriageway,1060.38,1078.74,359,79,7ttnVx9fCIA,1885,https://youtu.be/7ttnVx9fCIA?t=1060,

all right take the next row on your left it's just where the post box is left in there [Music] and then we're going to go ahead from here [Music] and if you can fill it and park up on the left hand side just by the little tree just kind of alongside the Tawny just anywhere over here that's great thank you all right Lewis what we're going to do now using the vehicle in front I'd like you to demonstrate how you would carry out the parallel park exercise okay so start alongside that vehicle in the road and then reverse back and finish within two columns try not to touch the pavement as you do this yeah,1222.679,1287.84,606,131,7ttnVx9fCIA,1885,https://youtu.be/7ttnVx9fCIA?t=1222,

[Music] you can pull in and park up on the left hand side somewhere safe thank you that's great there you can secure the car off the engine as well there you go thank you thank you thank you all right give me a few minutes kicks in just at the end oh you want to hear the results how was the drive um it was good um I know I made a bunch of mistakes um during the drive obviously and um and I can see why mock tests are very important before a test a lot of lifting the clutch up too quickly and not putting too much gas on as well was the main problem and when we were in the traffic yeah it was a bit of yeah and then I was like putting into third gear and driving off and then putting it into neutral and thinking why the hell I'm not going any faster so I was like there's a bit of a mix-up with the gears yeah there was a lot of mix up with the gears now the main faults that,1461.91,1541.039,880,195,7ttnVx9fCIA,1885,https://youtu.be/7ttnVx9fCIA?t=1461,
so unfortunately it wouldn't be a pass I didn't shut down too many but um the main reason was you know that first Junction where you thought you hit something and I was on the road wasn't that yeah I knew that one because the I I thought I was on the road yeah but I was like I should go I should go I should go so and then I was like no I'm gonna I kind of escalated so first when we got there you didn't stop behind the line you went over over the line that's all that first black call had to Swerve you yeah so that was a serious fault in itself okay then the fact that you tried to move off you stalled so that didn't help but the stall wasn't the serious fault okay but then afterwards we're now waiting and then that big Lori is approaching that's when it became a serious that's the key that's just when it kind of added to the series yeah so now that Laurie he couldn't get round,1543.2,1585.98,887,196,7ttnVx9fCIA,1885,https://youtu.be/7ttnVx9fCIA?t=1543,
you couldn't so the fact that he was so far away we should have we should have just gone wrong with it yeah and then when I entered the road I went a bit into water yeah and there was a car in the other lane so there's a few things on that one Junction alone so you should have really taken care of things when I hit jump well I thought I hit something I think that's when the nerves kicked in there yeah it was other than that I was I was all right and then there was that point where I had to take control with the break do you remember yeah the car the car yeah yeah so meeting situation there's um Park cars on the right there's a car coming towards you you can see it but you're kind of just squeezing into that space and I was like oh no don't do it I should have stopped I should have stopped before that's when afterwards I was stopping before yeah I still I was like okay so yeah new reverse Park here at the end okay,1587.299,1635.6,926,200,7ttnVx9fCIA,1885,https://youtu.be/7ttnVx9fCIA?t=1587,
got there in the end yeah but the the really good thing about that maneuver was you were checking every single time you changed Direction so I can't fault you on your observation one bit but yeah your control was a little bit you know I saw I was close to hitting the code I was so close I was like okay so that means I have to go forward a little bit Yeah and then I'm glad you didn't start again no I was gonna start again some people go right to the beginning and I'm like oh don't do that no I just I just put the car a bit on the right side and then just turned it more but but the thing is though which what I realized towards the end when I let go of the brick I saw the car moving back and then I ended up yeah I was like I'll just control it with that for now instead of lifting up the clutch so you know when we were driving on the A4 there what what speed was the,1637.46,1677.659,874,194,7ttnVx9fCIA,1885,https://youtu.be/7ttnVx9fCIA?t=1637,
A4 what speed are you driving at 35 35 now 35 is the highest we got to when we were going uphill you gradually got to 20. because it was going uphill I didn't because I know usually you're supposed to put into low gear to build if you want to use a lower gear but you want to build speed like you said I was not building I was like oh my God how long the gears like you went through the gears nicely but you just weren't accelerating enough yeah that's it now one of the cars just before that roundabout did who you but you didn't do anything wrong you know when when we saw oh that call who is behind me yeah yeah I know I was in my Lane this time you were doing everything fine you followed your lane nicely and you're using your mirror so no fault to you there but when we now got to the A4 he's overtaken because you're going so slow he was going to overtake anyways but yeah he,1680.539,1734.779,882,199,7ttnVx9fCIA,1885,https://youtu.be/7ttnVx9fCIA?t=1680,
wasn't overtaking Lane anyway so but at least I know next time I'm just gonna floor it yeah you knew you knew you had to speed up quickly just accelerate more then that turned by the Porsche garage the left turn yeah I slowed down you slowed down really well no I first slowed down later a bit too late you slowed it down well just Chuck it into second gear get that clutch out and make that turn because you know what it was a narrow turn yeah because I was like oh  if the car's coming out I need to if the car's coming out I need to be prepared so that's why I was like I slowed it down gear one speed in order to control the car so it was a bit too slow by the end when you went to first gear because now look imagine somebody that's on that 40 Road that's trying to turn in behind you it's not like that road was that narrow no it looked narrow because we've just,1736.52,1777.799,868,192,7ttnVx9fCIA,1885,https://youtu.be/7ttnVx9fCIA?t=1736,
been driving on that big open road and we're turning yeah because then there was like Park cars and stuff and was that the one no there were no Park cars the wrong one then the yellow box Junction you you did really well with that one you went into the yellow box waited in the right position waited until the road was clear I just thankful there was no uh there was no ambulance covered in that uh yeah there were loads of emergency services along that road so the main thing I should improve on would be the clutch I'm not clutch for the gate control let's get used to the gears in your car I think it might be this car or just with the other cars just don't go up and down so often and then meeting situations and um meeting situations definitely give away and get yeah those were not my main problems so Junction observation make sure when you're stopping at a t-junction that you're not going over that line stop behind look both ways go slowly forward,1779.36,1827.779,957,192,7ttnVx9fCIA,1885,https://youtu.be/7ttnVx9fCIA?t=1779,
if you can but don't go over the line to stop that was the first mistake the first of many oh we we got there in the end though there were a few times where I felt the left side was a bit close but it wasn't overly yeah yeah so it's something to bear in mind as well it's just that sometimes I just need to learn to follow the cup which uh which I don't do so most of the time but with your left hands yeah right well sometimes like as you saw I go over the line so like I misjudged the braking and then I go over the line yeah you never want to go over that line because that's the giveaway line yeah but I learned okay all right well that's the end of our mock test video today so hopefully that video will be useful and going forward to your test you can hopefully use this information hopefully yeah you'll be following your test you're just gonna make sure you definitely practice some more in the other car I,1830.539,1877.039,914,197,7ttnVx9fCIA,1885,https://youtu.be/7ttnVx9fCIA?t=1830,

foreign [Music] foreign guys welcome back to Clearview driving my name is Amin and today I'm doing a mock test with gabri how are you he's really nervous he's really really nervous now he has been driving in India for about five years and he has done around four hours of driving with an instructor right uh but you have been watching all of the videos online okay for watching your videos so hopefully you kind of know what to expect today yeah okay so we're gonna go on a mixture of Roads um and see how you get on there your test is coming up in about two weeks time yeah on the 26th of September I wasn't going to go into the details but in two weeks two weeks time your test is coming up okay so um do you know what's gonna happen in the mock test do you want me to tell you a little bit yeah yeah okay so I'm gonna keep telling you where to go in terms of instruction and,21.3,83.04,877,191,9Vazqa13EsI,1788,https://youtu.be/9Vazqa13EsI?t=21,
if you're not sure where you're going you could always ask I'm gonna get you to follow a few signs for a little while and then give you instructions and we're gonna do one maneuver and we may also do the emergency stop similar to everything you've been practicing with your instructor perfect okay now for anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe if you've not already and thank you for all the supporters and all the subscribers that have already subscribed you guys are great and it inspires me to kind of keep going so thank you now we're going to go straight into it but I'm going to ask you a quick question all right could you tell me about the general condition of your tires to be roadworthy so about your tires yeah how should your tires be for them to be safe on the road it's triplic there should not be any cut on the tires and the tire pressure should should be at the standard okay,84.96,133.44,951,194,9Vazqa13EsI,1788,https://youtu.be/9Vazqa13EsI?t=84,
pressure and what about the tread depth [Music] the depth of the line uh do you know the number yeah one pence okay that's 1.6 mm yeah perfect all right okay so when you're ready we're gonna get started so let's drive off one of you already [Music],136.08,161.85,248,60,9Vazqa13EsI,1788,https://youtu.be/9Vazqa13EsI?t=136,
when moving off on a road like this it's a good idea to Signal as there are lots of parked vehicles and somebody May benefit from your signal at the end of the road just press ok so at the end so I'm like girl breed deals with this Junction really well the view of the new road is obscured by Park vehicles and hedges he waits for a safe opportunity before edging forward,178.44,219.42,371,78,9Vazqa13EsI,1788,https://youtu.be/9Vazqa13EsI?t=178,
foreign just relax a little bit just breathe you'll be fine gopreet deals with all the meeting situations really well when meeting traffic on a road like this you want to try and make some progress as well as give way when it's safe to do so when moving in and out of these spaces it's really important to be using your mirrors so you're aware of any motorbikes or cyclists that may be around you as you've slowed down to meet traffic driving along this road there are speed bumps as a traffic calming measure as it's a 20 road now in terms of a driving test it doesn't matter how you go over these but you want to try to position your windscreen pillars with the sides of the speed bump if there are no obstructions closed that way the car goes over nice and level and you don't rock around if you can pull over and park up on the left anyone's safe foreign you're ready it's nothing don't worry,236.099,343.139,896,192,9Vazqa13EsI,1788,https://youtu.be/9Vazqa13EsI?t=236,
whenever you're moving off from stationary you want to look from the pavement towards the road and if you get distracted by something in the car you should always check towards the road again and check your right blind spot as a final check before moving away so if you pull an impark up on the left hand side in that space just then don't worry about the driveways on this occasion just get over here foreign dependent driving okay okay so we're gonna go down to the very end of this road turn left when we get to the roundabout turn left so that's left at the end again and then left if you forget you can ask okay all right so driver when you're ready,355.5,406.68,654,136,9Vazqa13EsI,1788,https://youtu.be/9Vazqa13EsI?t=355,
[Music] foreign [Music] this new road there's quite a lot of traffic on the main road so good Reef has to get eye contact with the traffic on the main road and he does so really well he also negotiates this left-hand turn really nicely by coming out of the junction and then turning left had he stayed any earlier we would have gone on the pavement this is around but I need to take first action now on the roundabout we're taking the first exit cigarette we needed to go into the left hand lane he goes into the second lane it does go towards the A40 but it puts him into the overtaking position,423.5,475.319,596,127,9Vazqa13EsI,1788,https://youtu.be/9Vazqa13EsI?t=423,
because we're going left here now at this point grumpy was about to go the wrong way going the wrong way would not have been a fault but if he started going towards the right and then suddenly switched back into the left lane that would have been a big issue all right now I'd like you to follow some signs towards Oxford for a little while,503.4,521.7,340,70,9Vazqa13EsI,1788,https://youtu.be/9Vazqa13EsI?t=503,
initially as we're joining this carriageway from the slip Road group we thought we had to move into the middle Lane as we're merging into the traffic but there is a sign on the left hand side which shows us that we have a new Lane that joins the carriageway rather than merging into the middle Lane foreign carriageway is Flowing quite well we do not need to be in this Lane as we're currently in the overtaking lane unnecessarily always driving the first Lane unless you're overtaking or turning right the second and the third lane are both known as the overtaking lanes gabri gets marked down as a serious fault for position normal driving as a vehicle now moves into the left hand lane to overtake him,542.519,587.94,704,149,9Vazqa13EsI,1788,https://youtu.be/9Vazqa13EsI?t=542,
so when traveling Along on a road like this always keep in the left hand lean unless you're overtaking slower moving traffic or you're turning right now when following instructions on a Sat Nav if you can see your right turn is in two to three miles then you shouldn't move into the overtaking lane early you should stay on the left until the turn is seven or eight hundred yards and then move over in towards the position to turn now traveling a bit further down this road there's a bit more traffic and go brick gets another serious bolt for position normal driving as he's very much positioned on the white line to the right now in traffic like this motorbikes tend to filter through from the left and from the right so he should have stayed in the middle of his Lane he was leaning to the right to see the road ahead and then a motorbike passes through from the right so this does go down as a serious fault,609.18,654.6,911,184,9Vazqa13EsI,1788,https://youtu.be/9Vazqa13EsI?t=609,
I think there's a bit of traffic in the direction we were going into so what we'll do is um we're going to turn off here instead so we're going to take this exit so we're gonna take the exit here,683.579,701.16,195,46,9Vazqa13EsI,1788,https://youtu.be/9Vazqa13EsI?t=683,
as we moved into the left-hand Lane quite slowly the indicator did not click off now we're still indicating left as we're going forward and this signal could be very misleading the signal only switches off as Capri steers towards the left to give way to an emergency vehicle that was approaching behind us but remember to switch off your indicator if it doesn't turn off by itself foreign,745.74,771.24,388,75,9Vazqa13EsI,1788,https://youtu.be/9Vazqa13EsI?t=745,

[Music] in the distance ahead there's a bus lane starting on the left now the time that we're driving here we could have used the bus lane but go brick didn't realize this and he switches out of the bus lane which is fine he checks his mirrors but he doesn't indicate it's always a good idea to indicate when switching lanes as somebody May benefit from your signal as there are pedestrians and vehicles in the distance all right now when we get to the roundabout I'd like you to take the second exit going towards Heathrow [Music],836.45,901.91,531,111,9Vazqa13EsI,1788,https://youtu.be/9Vazqa13EsI?t=836,
as we've started in the right hand lane this Lane only goes to exit three and four as it's only for going past 12 o'clock if you follow the white line to the left it does not allow us to take the second exit back now here is a prime example of something you want to avoid doing on your driving test gurpreet's in position to take the third exit but he was asked to take the second exit at this point he's checking his mirrors and he switches into the left lane do not switch lanes at this point as the lane he's just switched into also went right so this could have been a very dangerous Lane change if somebody had been approaching it's always better to just go the wrong way instead of switching lanes at this point driving I'm going to give you directions as normal for now so we're no longer following any signs when driving along on a carriageway like this always try to keep the center of your lane along your left shoulder that,930.959,991.26,934,197,9Vazqa13EsI,1788,https://youtu.be/9Vazqa13EsI?t=930,

about ahead of us is the second exit so at this point gurpreet should have checked his mirrors and moved towards the left-hand Lane he's checking his mirrors but he's simply not switching until the exit is right in front of him this could easily be a dangerous point to switch lanes as the traffic waiting on exit 2 will now start to enter and speed up as they enter [Music] traffic lights let's turn right yes please due to the fact that it's raining and the road surfaces were wet and we were going through a narrow space Grand Prix should have slowed down some more,1086.02,1143.66,568,118,9Vazqa13EsI,1788,https://youtu.be/9Vazqa13EsI?t=1086,

okay we're gonna come up to the next roundabout and take the third exit towards greenford [Music] as we're taking the third exit which is signposted past 12 o'clock we need to start in the right hand lane [Music],1192.32,1207.19,212,50,9Vazqa13EsI,1788,https://youtu.be/9Vazqa13EsI?t=1192,
as we're heading towards our exit Capri does check his mirrors and signals to exit but on the exit the two lanes are starting to merge and he does not check his mirrors when the lanes are merging we should be checking as the left hand lane has priority at this point [Music] just make sure the full beams are not on the blue light you need to pull the indicator towards you [Music] know you want to go go with what's on the road take the next Road on your left just here and just live together here all right what we're going to do now is I'm gonna get you to reverse into a space so if you can just go forward and now reverse into any space left or right just make sure you finish within the lines of the Bay reverse into a space yes,1269.24,1349.36,734,158,9Vazqa13EsI,1788,https://youtu.be/9Vazqa13EsI?t=1269,
foreign don't use the lines in front they're not lined up you can use the Gopi does have to go forward in order to fix his parking maneuver but before reversing you should always look all around again and he does not do this this is why he gets a serious Vault for reversing observation he does finish in the space by the end but he's not checking over his shoulders,1383.179,1417.26,366,75,9Vazqa13EsI,1788,https://youtu.be/9Vazqa13EsI?t=1383,

said just following signs to Oxford we came into this uh carriageway where there were three lanes all right you were driving in the left one and as soon as we came in you were trying to move into the middle and then you did move into the middle and then you carried on driving in the middle why are we in the middle I don't know yeah did you notice all three lanes are going the same way yeah so you just carried on in the overtaking lane and we did have two cars run over take you on the left so we have no reason to be in that lane do we yeah so the left lane is known as the normal driving lane I I put the right lane is so what it is is the left lane is the normal driving lane right and anything after that right is the overtaking lane okay so the Middle Lane was the overtakingly [Music] that that's for overtaking so both of them were yeah and then the second serious fault was the same thing but it was your,1524.059,1592.88,915,201,9Vazqa13EsI,1788,https://youtu.be/9Vazqa13EsI?t=1524,
position in the lane so when you were driving and there was loads of traffic yeah it was not in the middle you were not in the Middle where were you positioned it was on the right yeah but it was quite right you were very close to that line and how many motorbikes passed you on the right all right yeah there was a red motorbike really he went back close to you all the cars yeah I didn't see that one bikes yeah you're right yeah so it's just we're in such heavy traffic you want to try and be in the center of your lane I know you're trying to look ahead but your position is going really close to that line and then well because of the traffic motorbikes are now are you okay you were really nervous yeah so when we were approaching that roundabout to take the second exit towards Heathrow you started on the right lane and then when we before we entered you said oh I'm in the wrong lane and I didn't say,1594.14,1647.539,909,196,9Vazqa13EsI,1788,https://youtu.be/9Vazqa13EsI?t=1594,
anything I taught uh but when I found uh the space cap then you moved to a middle Lane right that time you did yeah and I know you checked your mirrors but I I think yeah I was in the right lane I guess so as we went into that roundabout you're taking the exit and you started on the far right you did check your mirrors and moved into Lane three which was safe because that was your lane and then we had to change again to exit I wouldn't do that because it's just putting you in danger because somebody from over there might be trying to move over this way so the mirror doesn't cover that area so it's just one of those things where you want to avoid changing lanes on a roundabout yeah on a 30 Road you went up to about 34 yeah speeding up a little bit this maneuver here okay I know you're in the space perfectly now um and you were using the lines in front and they're not they're not aligned right,1649.159,1707.6,904,195,9Vazqa13EsI,1788,https://youtu.be/9Vazqa13EsI?t=1649,
but my main concern with this maneuver was your observation at the very beginning you looked around while reversing but then you had to go back and forward a little bit yeah and you didn't look around you were just kind of doing your own thing using mirrors and grape but what if somebody walked in from over here we wouldn't see them so for that alone that would be a serious thought okay so that's the end of your mock test today is this what you expected yeah it that's okay there was just a lot of traffic so we had to change the route a little bit because the road was just blocked but um yeah all right you can easily kind of Polish these up but make sure you're getting a bit more practice in between now and your tests definitely so do some lessons yeah okay all right thank you that's the end of our mock test video so hopefully that video has been useful for you guys as well um but yeah the mistakes you're kind of making that's what you get with,1712.159,1773.779,957,196,9Vazqa13EsI,1788,https://youtu.be/9Vazqa13EsI?t=1712,

all right some more instructions for you to follow now so when we get to the next roundabout turn right second exit and then at the traffic lights turn right along this road Rafe gets a serious fault for clearance as he gets too close to a parked car on the left Aim to leave at least one meter of clearance on the sides if you're driving through a narrow Gap you need to slow down always remember the smaller the Gap the slower you go [Music] before overtaking you should always make sure that it's safe and necessary aim to leave at least one and a half meters of clearance before overtaking a cyclist Rafe gets a serious fault when overtaking the cyclists as he starts overtaking on the bend and also doesn't leave her a lot of clearance [Music] you should never overtake when there's a bend in front or the brow of a hill or even when there are Junctions about always wait for a nice straight stretch of road where it's safe,670.56,741.72,928,194,BaUJth23hsw,1836,https://youtu.be/BaUJth23hsw?t=670,

foreign it's always a good idea to have regular checks in your mirrors so that you're aware of your surroundings in case of any cyclists or motorbikes that may have turned up while you're waiting when you're waiting next to a zebra Crossing like this always make sure to look behind your windscreen pillars before moving off as it's really easy to miss pedestrians foreign myself in the foot here I shot myself in the foot or did I well find out I hope this is the right turn you man,760.8,814.32,483,100,BaUJth23hsw,1836,https://youtu.be/BaUJth23hsw?t=760,

sometimes he checks but then there's a delay between actually checking and moving off so always do the right blind spot check as a final check [Music] I'm not gonna do it here thank you kindly when carrying out the emergency stop if somebody turns up once you've moved off the examiner will remind you that you are not going to carry out the emergency stop until there's a safer opportunity so always wait for the signal and the examiner will make sure the road is clear before they give you that signal yes all right so we're still doing the emergency stop wait for my signal and stop as quickly as you can okay okay stop stop all right thank you I'm not gonna ask you to do that again drive off when you're ready there we go [Music] okay we're just looking for a place to pull over and park if there is one along the left here it doesn't have to be perfect just kind of out the way we're gonna fit in here yeah box myself in slightly and just reverse,1452.72,1528.919,952,199,BaUJth23hsw,1836,https://youtu.be/BaUJth23hsw?t=1452,

wheel it's because you're sitting on the right your judgment's better on the right but you kind of move to the left a bit too much so we got quite close on two separate occasions yep um then there is your judgment on when you overtook that cyclist going around that left Bend yeah that one uh yeah it's not a great place is it no it wasn't great because as soon as you started moving over I was like oh why can't I know you could see better that was the thing yeah I could see a little bit I saw it was clear and I thought um within the lane still it should be all right baby some space as well I thought we did one and a half meters of clearance which I didn't feel great and then we're kind of cutting into the space in front of her because you're trying to keep it below 20 as well yeah yeah so it just should have just jumped back and left it yeah yeah because the band was approaching me I've had someone turned,1596.12,1639.98,916,200,BaUJth23hsw,1836,https://youtu.be/BaUJth23hsw?t=1596,
up it would have caught them off guard as well yeah yeah so not a great place to overtake there um generally you know what you're doing your drive's nice but there were a lot of mirror checks missing you don't check them there I mean it's I I check mirrors a lot but sometimes I also check them a little bit earlier that then like at the last minute kind of thing if that makes sense as well like if you're driving along and you're switching lanes and you know if somebody's next to you I know you know they're there but generally as you're driving for doing a left hand or a right turn you don't check and driving in London driving in busy areas I often do cyclists catch up oh yeah yeah it was yeah I probably don't yeah I need to work on that in that case but yeah because sometimes as well as I just I kind of I do the mirror check but it's not like I should be also be doing more,1641.299,1690.08,884,193,BaUJth23hsw,1836,https://youtu.be/BaUJth23hsw?t=1641,
of a check for the area I remember you were looking kind of before turning and stuff but there were loads of mirror tricks missing generally for turns now your parallel park exercise how was that oh that was terrible my Parable parking is being terrible for yonks I have uh relied extensively on uh on normally on senses and whatnot to make my life easier but that one was fairly terrible now you even by the end you did have the left tire on the pavement yeah I thought I did yeah at that stage I was like I saw another car coming so I was like you know what I'm just gonna leave it here for a moment do you know how I said to you park within two carlands yeah you look like you were trying to park within one yeah probably you're parking too tight yeah it's just easier if you kind of gradually take it in right yeah yeah I should have blind spots are a little bit of a concern as well so when you're reversing you did look before starting which was great but as,1692.059,1745.039,964,201,BaUJth23hsw,1836,https://youtu.be/BaUJth23hsw?t=1692,
you're reversing we're not checking and you know there's loads of houses there's people that have started Crossing um and even your emergency stop it was a bit sluggish yeah for an emergency I should have put yeah it's I should have just slammed it yeah the break started off a bit like got there in the end but yeah it was a bit didn't love it but that wasn't a major no it was still just to work on yeah but what was a major was you not checking your blind spots before moving off so even just the fact that you didn't look at the end before going again yeah that in itself would have been a serious yeah okay yeah so you know what you're doing but it's these little things that you may not have realized because oh yeah this is the thing yeah exactly this so in terms of a driving test these are things yeah definitely watch out for yeah okay good to know all right that's the end of your mock test today is this,1747.14,1795.74,915,193,BaUJth23hsw,1836,https://youtu.be/BaUJth23hsw?t=1747,
what you expected from today ah to be honest yes I knew it was gonna to be honest it's one of those things you know you drive for long enough and you just go it is what it is and then you're like oh no when you actually do a test yeah it's yeah which is why a lot of experienced drivers would actually fail their tests absolutely had to retake it exactly so yeah all right well that's the end of the video thank you for everyone that's been watching don't forget to follow me on Instagram on Tick Tock it's everywhere it's clearly driving I always forget this bit but that's the end of our video today and bye [Music],1797.48,1835.0,617,135,BaUJth23hsw,1836,https://youtu.be/BaUJth23hsw?t=1797,

there are various signs along this road showing us there is a width restriction approaching now in the distance we need to pass through the left-hand side of the road through a narrowing of seven feet the van ahead of us goes through the middle of the road and Grenada starts to follow them width restrictions are designed as a traffic calming measure to restrict the size of the vehicles that use these roads and also to slow the traffic down this section in the middle of the road is for use for emergency vehicles only the gate here is normally shut but it happened to be open on this occasion [Music] no no no no no no no no no no no let me help you with this sorry release your pedals okay completely okay sorry because we turned into it very late there all right back to you no no no no no no no no no no release your pedals okay completely okay sorry because we turned into it very late there all right back to you [Music],346.56,431.71,929,187,780JQ_cSxCU,1705,https://youtu.be/780JQ_cSxCU?t=346,

foreign [Music] the criteria for this maneuver is to demonstrate parking within two-car lengths now grunard does have a tendency to steer with one hand and he does stare quite quickly because of this he has to turn the wheel back and forth a few times in order to get into that space it's a good idea to use both hands on the steering wheel even if your hands cross over the top of the steering wheel this is not a concern as long as you have good control thank you I'm going to take it a little inside that's fine thank you okay we're okay where we are okay should I left whenever you're ready tap the next Road on your right piece [Music],675.42,728.85,640,137,780JQ_cSxCU,1705,https://youtu.be/780JQ_cSxCU?t=675,

foreign Junction we're gonna go ahead and then bear left we're in the best Lane for this okay [Music] Darkness [Music] as we're going forward we're now entering a 20 miles per hour speed limit you can see this with the speed limit listed on both sides facing you here which is known as a Gateway sign now after this point there are speed limit signs throughout the road that are scattered as we're driving through gunal starts driving up to 26 miles per hour on this road so it gets a serious spot for this foreign [Music],813.959,882.09,522,112,780JQ_cSxCU,1705,https://youtu.be/780JQ_cSxCU?t=813,

[Music] the traffic lights did start changing but we did not have time and it was not safe to stop at either of these traffic lights but when one traffic light starts changing you want to be wary as the next one may be changing soon after and take the next Road on your left since the last Gateway sign that we had this is the next speed limit change on the left hand side you can see the 30 Zone listed and from here on it is now 30 miles per hour after this point there will be no more signs but you can see it's 30 as there are Street lamps but no signs no traffic calming measures and turn left [Music] foreign [Music] about follow the road ahead it's the second exit at this roundabout we're meant to be going straight ahead but Kunal goes into the roundabout and starts to go right without an indicator now had there been a vehicle ahead of us this would have gone down as a serious fault,999.12,1088.82,894,192,780JQ_cSxCU,1705,https://youtu.be/780JQ_cSxCU?t=999,
I'm just gonna go back around because that exit there okay okay put your right signal to go that round [Music] as Canal brings the clutch up you can see that the car is jolting a few times in some of the gear changes the reason for this is because when lifting the clutch up Canal tends to keep his heel on the ground and the clutch slides from the top of his foot to the middle arch in his foot making it harder to release the clutch you want to aim to keep the clutch on the ball of your foot that way your foot slides in and out rather than flexing your foot [Music] this next roundabout we're taking the second exit it's like 10 o'clock towards Holston [Music] ah second exit right second exit um should I just take the first one since I indicated look you can just turn it off oh okay [Music] all right now the traffic lights turn right okay [Music] foreign [Music],1096.02,1177.63,870,192,780JQ_cSxCU,1705,https://youtu.be/780JQ_cSxCU?t=1096,

that's in front of us now starts turning around on this sharp bend on the main road now it's not a great place to turn around but as soon as we notice them we should have started breaking as they could have continued reversing now we have got a large Lorry behind us so it's not ideal to stop but worst case scenario you may need to break [Music],1264.7,1283.67,346,75,780JQ_cSxCU,1705,https://youtu.be/780JQ_cSxCU?t=1264,
found like the worst place to try and turn around about go right that exit right yes please [Music] foreign [Music] if you could pull in and park up on the left on this yellow line just behind this large truck it's fine just take it really slow because it is just just wait just wait I think it's best to read yeah [Music] and just keep going a bit further not too close just keep it going forward yeah you're going all the way and then just stop there we're parking there okay thank you so kill the plant switch off the engine as well brilliant thank you [Laughter] oh bless him oh God okay all right well that's the end of your driving test how was your drive um the drive itself was fine I I know the places where I've made mistake yeah was it what you expected not really they're like very silly mistakes that could have been easily avoided especially the first one I think what happened was there was a van in,1305.12,1416.96,914,194,780JQ_cSxCU,1705,https://youtu.be/780JQ_cSxCU?t=1305,
front of us that did not obviously take the left turn and then but why do you think he didn't take that space because it was too small okay but obviously I mean at that point even I I thought that it would be small for us I saw your prices it went yeah no no no no no no I can see what's about to happen and and that happened quite a lot I mean even at the signal where you had to use your brake I didn't actually oh you didn't know I was about to okay okay I just left it to you because you I was thinking oh we can stop and then you started breaking and I thought okay it's gonna break and then your break is so late that you're going to the traffic like I didn't actually break I I think I took too much time thinking what needs to be done yeah um yeah those two are the obvious ones um I think when it comes to miners when we took the first lift I think it was a,1418.28,1464.36,866,194,780JQ_cSxCU,1705,https://youtu.be/780JQ_cSxCU?t=1418,
little wide it could have been oh yeah the steering on that one yeah I think that that's those are all the things I noted but I'm sure there are more okay so in terms of driving you know what you're doing you tend to stay with one hand kind of wrapped around which again it's not a fault but it wasn't great control for your steering because of how you were steering with one hand so just be careful because you're going to easily lose control of the steering wheel turning like that okay um especially if you're nervous in the test you're going to get sweaty Palms yeah and if you get sweaty palm and on the steering wheel and your hand slips off even a little bit that's a serious spot right there just use both hands on the steering wheel especially for the tighter turns and stuff because we needed that even when we did the reverse park it felt like you were really trying to do everything with one just use your other hand yeah otherwise the control in the actual parking was really nice,1466.4,1515.0,993,200,780JQ_cSxCU,1705,https://youtu.be/780JQ_cSxCU?t=1466,
yeah the one end thing is just a bad habit I've developed over the years yeah so try and stay with boyfriend especially with the tens and stuff yeah um overall you know what you're doing roundabouts we had a few bit of trouble there didn't we yeah so we come up to that roundabout we're going straight and you've started now going right and you thought that was the second exit which again is fine but now we're doing a right turn with no signal right then I had to tell you go back round and then the funny thing is on the one after I said okay we're gonna go second exit left turn it was like a second exit but it's on the left you put your signal on and you went oh what do I do now I've put a left signal on and I said well turn it off I thought so because I already indicated that I was turning like yeah but when you were in the correct Lane for one or two so you simply just need to turn it off okay,1516.799,1565.159,906,200,780JQ_cSxCU,1705,https://youtu.be/780JQ_cSxCU?t=1516,
I thought it needs to be turned on only after I passed the first exit which is why if I ask you if I should but we hadn't even entered the roundabout yet we were still on the lead up so we can simply turn it off yeah go in get to the position send it back on makes sense yeah it's not setting so um with the gears we had a bit of trouble you kind of go up to three and two three and two which is fine but most of the time we were on 20 miles per hour roads and there was a lot of heavy traffic oh yeah and I think that that one I saw 30 on the display so I thought okay that's 30 because there was no one I had as well and so I speed up a little and then yeah we were about 26 at that point and I and I know that there is 20 but I thought let me wait for him to see a 20 sign and there was a big 20,1566.96,1608.36,798,196,780JQ_cSxCU,1705,https://youtu.be/780JQ_cSxCU?t=1566,
sign on the right and then I just had to tell you okay the whole area we if you if you're going into a 30 Zone you'll see 30 Zone okay and then we enter and we when we came up to these roundabouts around here there was a dirty Zone sign and then all of the rest of it was 30 and then we went back into 20 again briefly yeah so you got to be careful of signs they will be repeated um as the area is quite busy it wouldn't have been there okay um I'm thinking I'm forgetting something oh okay right at the beginning we had one Junction where you were quite cautious and you stopped and you started giving away to two cars yeah I think we had priority we did yeah I realized that when I I asked the other person to move yeah and then once once they moved in I was basically ready to start but then the other guy also came in is it okay to invite someone into the,1610.88,1660.14,859,190,780JQ_cSxCU,1705,https://youtu.be/780JQ_cSxCU?t=1610,
room like that yeah because then you're taking on the responsibility that the road is safe but what if there was like a motorbike overtaking you cool yeah so never invite someone like that [Music] um yeah just just be a little bit more careful with your Junctions try and stay with both hands yeah and don't follow others blindly that was so funny I was leading up to it I was like no he's not gonna do it he's not gonna do it it's not he's not he's doing it all right well that's the end of our mock test video today hopefully that video has been useful for you guys as well good luck with your Tesla how it goes thank you thank you so much okay [Music],1662.179,1702.49,654,145,780JQ_cSxCU,1705,https://youtu.be/780JQ_cSxCU?t=1662,

you're ready let's drive off [Music] hi guys welcome back to another mock test so today we have chairs with us now most of his practice has been with family now he has picked up a few habits as you can see here he starts inviting The Pedestrian into the road you don't want to be doing this as you could be inviting them into potential danger you want to let The Pedestrian make up their mind and cross on their own account hello this day started off quite dark and gloomy so be sure to turn on your headlights so that you can see and that you can be seen before starting to drive in the rain turn on your demysters so that your windows don't steam up as you're driving also be familiar with the windscreen wipers as you may need to adjust the speed on the go there are lots of factors to consider when driving in the rain as you're following distance and braking distance needs to be doubled so don't drive too fast [Music] foreign [Music],135.599,224.53,940,202,_TzNVpdxtmY,2077,https://youtu.be/_TzNVpdxtmY?t=135,

that was round about turn left is the first exit and at the next round up we're going to go straight second exit second roundabout s so left and then straight when using the traffic ahead on a roundabout as a blocker make sure there's enough space for you to enter without slowing down the vehicle to your right chess takes this Gap fairly late so if the vehicle on the right hand side had moved off faster this could have been a serious fault thank you [Music] separate [Music] will we sleep tight from tarmac visible whenever you're stopping especially as it is raining and the pedals are slippery you don't want to suddenly slip off the clutch and Lurch into the car in front foreign [Music] as we enter this roundabout chess gets a serious fault for Junction's observation as there was a red car on the roundabout that we should have waited for as he enters the also straight lines the roundabout and goes into the right hand,252.48,342.0,929,189,_TzNVpdxtmY,2077,https://youtu.be/_TzNVpdxtmY?t=252,

[Music] so any questions on us you can't answer let's do with how you're driving [Music] okay you can keep asking away I just won't reply until later approaching the next mini roundabout chess gets a serious fault for junction observation as there was a vehicle to the right and by the time we entered the roundabout the Gap was too late so we needed to give way to the vehicle approaching [Music] oh oh oh man oh man [Music] and that's what my sister told me to remember remember and look what I've just done [Music] that's because we have so much are you looking at me because you're not laughing I get it I get it I get it all right do you know what is yeah oh I saw him last second I was thinking why is he not stopping I was like okay maybe he's just I don't know I don't know oh man that's really pissing me off man that's right foreign,621.39,742.5,842,193,_TzNVpdxtmY,2077,https://youtu.be/_TzNVpdxtmY?t=621,

all right the traffic lights we're gonna go right okay I guess this is what mock test is afford though to make the mistakes you have to write them down study it tell your instructor this is why [Music] what's going on [Music] right yeah [Music] so what's this cruise control cruise control you won't do anything unless you're driving above 20. stay focused man what are you doing [Music] we're turning right onto a dual carriageway where there are two lanes always try and make a nice wide turn so that you end up in the left hand lane in the new road chess turns into the right hand lane and then checks his mirrors and switches back into the left it would have been easier to just make a wide turn and turn into the left hand lane foreign just after the traffic lights turn left just after them yeah okay [Music] then the other way all right I helped you out there a little bit okay well it,780.959,909.36,892,192,_TzNVpdxtmY,2077,https://youtu.be/_TzNVpdxtmY?t=780,
wasn't us going too fast yeah [Music] come the other way all right I helped you out there a little bit okay well I was going too fast yeah I had to break [Music] if you can pull over and park up on the left hand side anywhere safe not too close in [Music] a little break are you ready ready all right let's drive up when you're ready that right blind spot check is very hard there are large puddles on both sides and the middle of the road is higher due to the camera of the road you can drive into the middle of the road as long as the road ahead is clear it's best to do this to avoid slashing pedestrians and getting the brakes wet but only do this when it's safe to do so and if it's not safe then you should slow down to go through the puddle [Music] foreign [Music],910.68,990.7,771,177,_TzNVpdxtmY,2077,https://youtu.be/_TzNVpdxtmY?t=910,
you need to slow down more if he's getting in your lane yeah why do you think he was in the middle earlier though I was still saying what you're doing to myself [Music] this is going to be a little embarrassing all this crap [Music] yeah now I know why my mom said anyone could drive in a straight line that's right sure [Music] he's really wise she's a very wise woman uh [Music] I'm trying to make it a GT to be the first person to pass with the least amount of lessons done because I'm very competitive and my oldest sister passed first time and she did like 20 hours of business 20 hours is a lot by the way foreign at the end of this road turn right as we're going forward this road Bears round to the right and then at the t-junction we needed to turn right chess turns left and then turns right [Music] thank you sorry about apology [Music],1020.839,1123.64,847,191,_TzNVpdxtmY,2077,https://youtu.be/_TzNVpdxtmY?t=1020,
okay we're gonna start the independent,1141.14,1141.14,38,7,_TzNVpdxtmY,2077,https://youtu.be/_TzNVpdxtmY?t=1141,
okay we're gonna start the independent driving now I'm going to give you a series of directions to follow yeah we get to the roundabout and follow the road ahead it is the fourth exit on the head fourth exit ahead yeah okay it's kind of to the right and then at the traffic lights we started round about follow the road ahead full of exit and then at the traffic lights turn right okay [Music] Chez does do this roundabout really well but as we're approaching the third exit he needs to be checking his mirrors thoroughly towards the left and signaling left to take the exit he does check his mirrors but he doesn't signal left to exit thank you [Music] another traffic lights [Music] positioning shows as we're driving along a 50 miles per hour dual carriageway we should have been planning this right turn a bit earlier and we should have switched Lanes now chess tries to change lanes but too late so we ended up going left,1141.14,1214.039,926,192,_TzNVpdxtmY,2077,https://youtu.be/_TzNVpdxtmY?t=1141,
so we're turning right here I missed it I missed it I missed it [Music] I tried to get I should have gone that late way earlier [Music] I'll check the last time left yet [Music],1220.34,1262.99,177,44,_TzNVpdxtmY,2077,https://youtu.be/_TzNVpdxtmY?t=1220,

so we're making the u-turn on the roundabout yeah okay I suggest you moving to the right hand lane [Music] so we're making a U-turn here all right foreign [Music] chess gets marked down for judgment when crossing the path of oncoming traffic with this right turn there was a white car approaching and the Gap was fairly small but the car was approaching at speed it would have been safer to keep waiting until the traffic lights changed [Music] just ahead of us this Lori is moving out of the petrol station into the left-hand Lane chess decides to overtake them and the Lorry gets up to the speed of the road so he's unable to overtake [Music],1307.88,1378.72,644,138,_TzNVpdxtmY,2077,https://youtu.be/_TzNVpdxtmY?t=1307,

as we enter the roundabout to follow the a30 towards stains chess needs to follow the white line on the left hand side and that's going to guide him towards the exit but as he enters the roundabout he stays too close to the right and ends up going back round [Music] oh Cheers Cheers wrong lane can I go that way is it possible whatever you think is safe oh yeah [Music] I'm sorry [Music],1513.559,1567.44,388,87,_TzNVpdxtmY,2077,https://youtu.be/_TzNVpdxtmY?t=1513,
all right I'm making this test longer than it is going to the right lane so it's still going around from here we ate fancy [Music] so this would have been our second exit yeah and we're leaving at the fourth [Music] I need to be in that Middle Lane I'm gonna get there though [Music] you don't need to switch my way [Music] you know what you're doing from this point yeah okay now I need to switch it's not a switch let's go it's not Lane change your lane is spiraling into the middle into the middle [Music] when exiting the roundabout hadchas stayed in the Middle Lane it would have taken us into the overtaking lane on this exit but he wanted to switch into the left lane so he should have signal left to make this Lane switch [Music] all right that's the that's the test how's your drive chess do you know he's here a few guys are looking yeah are you,1584.02,1689.24,855,196,_TzNVpdxtmY,2077,https://youtu.be/_TzNVpdxtmY?t=1584,
coming to do this please I know what you're thinking ah easy easy it's not easy especially if you ain't done it before if you've done a mock testing first but you ain't please humble yourself just humble me today uh this is my area I drive it every day I've been driven around this area for like and years like my parents been driving me around and then when I travel down my drive this area and I know I failed because of the many thoughts I've done but uh I believe that in terms of driving I know how to like I know like the clutch pedals gears I'm not really I don't think that's a problem if you do you probably have to say but I personally don't have a problem with that I think my problem is observations of Road markings roundabouts I said clock House Lane wasn't my problem and look what happened um so those are my two problems and I really actually believe stopping as well like on the same all right there's a lot,1691.039,1745.1,925,196,_TzNVpdxtmY,2077,https://youtu.be/_TzNVpdxtmY?t=1691,
going on okay I'm gonna try and summarize it as best as I can yeah um roundabouts mini roundabouts I feel like you tend to follow the traffic in front of you and that happened on two roundabouts at least okay you tend to switch lanes in roundabouts without realizing with a lot of the times when you don't need to you kind of drift over you straight line them a little bit and once that's going with that indicator like changing position in the roundabout changing lanes okay then gradually coming in a lot of the time it's like oh I'm leaving here just move about so the safety side of it it's a little bit rushed you have a very bad habit of coasting do you know what that is when you're driving with the clutch now yeah so coming up to that turn when I had to break we're coming up to that turn you did start breaking but your clutch was down and it stayed down and you did the gear change but again that has no effect,1746.72,1793.88,921,196,_TzNVpdxtmY,2077,https://youtu.be/_TzNVpdxtmY?t=1746,
if I'm if the clutch is down so we we was coasting onto that that's why I had to break and even kind of approaching a lot of the stops there's a lot of sudden kind of movements really um you just need to take your time with these things now let's talk about that Lorry when you try to overtake him what happened there well I tried to stick to the speed limit yeah this guy was crawling I tried when you say crawling how slow was it when you initially decided I believe he was just going if I remember I think I was like correct me if I'm wrong you obviously see on the video I want to say I was like from 30 to 35 just when I so I pulled onto the Dual Carriage Bridge yeah and he just moved in front of us hadn't he yeah yeah you know you're saying he was slow he was when he come in he was a bit slow but he was trying to get on with it okay so,1795.86,1842.179,845,195,_TzNVpdxtmY,2077,https://youtu.be/_TzNVpdxtmY?t=1795,
when you decided to overtake him he was trying to speed up as well yeah yeah and now we're level with him and then you're eager to move over and he's right there yeah yeah so you don't really need to overtake him that was it I didn't because I did but he turned left he turned in and he was he was trying to get up to the speed of the road yeah yeah I was just yeah I just thought I thought I tried to get some brownie points you know everything came in the right lane but uh and then the point where I had to grab the steering with the van when you said what's his van doing in the middle that one is online as well because there's puddles everywhere and you could see what he was in in the middle and you should have taken a bit more charge then yeah so do you think I should have just stopped completely we should have slowed down and stopped here if not slowly went through that but you kind of carried on with your speed as well,1843.86,1885.08,933,203,_TzNVpdxtmY,2077,https://youtu.be/_TzNVpdxtmY?t=1843,
but it's better off just stopping really okay what are the positives because I just feel like I'm getting more than that obviously of course you know how to control your car but the car that you're driving in is different from this one so a lot of the times there was a bit of a bit of coordination off you know when you were accelerating yeah yeah that's just something that you can smooth out with a bit of um just getting familiar with the biting point a bit more but yeah you know what you're doing on the roads but you don't read the road markings you're right you remember when we did that um that time when we had a gravy and W behind us and I said at the end of the road turn right this is after your remark of my mum said um anyone can drive in a straight line we're going up to the end of this road and I said turn right at the end we come up to this bit where this road is kind,1886.64,1927.38,888,192,_TzNVpdxtmY,2077,https://youtu.be/_TzNVpdxtmY?t=1886,
of forking into two levels I was supposed to be on the right hand lane because then I was parking out well I went to the end of the nail on the left side I was thinking why are cars turning right on that side and now I'm thinking oh I also if you're on that lane so you basically made a left turn and then you were trying to make a right turn you needed to just follow the road so you didn't see the marking is that legal what I did you're allowed to do that yes of course but you needed a left indicator made it way more difficult well there was no like big deal with what happened okay so we kind of ran out of time because we um took a long detour and it's stuck in loads of traffic so we didn't get to do our maneuver so when did I fail at the roundabout in the traffic is that the serious one it was a little bit before that no on Ford Bridge roundabout be you firstly went in front of that red,1929.12,1977.36,899,200,_TzNVpdxtmY,2077,https://youtu.be/_TzNVpdxtmY?t=1929,
car which you shouldn't have taken that gap before the red car do you remember the red car Ford Bridge roundabout you kind of went in there was a red car approaching and then as soon as you went in you've switched Lanes and then when you're trying to exit you're trying to move back to the left so for the bridge around about has two lanes isn't it the one that's closest to home the first big roundabout we went oh yeah yeah that one yeah when I went straight ahead so when you entered you were on the left weren't you yeah but as soon as you went in you were on the right yeah and then as you exit your nail back on the left do you see what I mean about straight lining so I should have stayed on the left you should have been on the outskirts the whole time is that a fault is that a serious fault Lane discipline whoa so I didn't even fail when I thought I failed that's even worse,1980.0,2023.86,885,193,_TzNVpdxtmY,2077,https://youtu.be/_TzNVpdxtmY?t=1980,

okay yeah okay the black car ahead of us is reversing onto a driveway now Simon should have tried to maintain at least two car lengths of clearance she does get quite close to gets marked down for this [Music] the vehicle that was reversing had no idea that we're approaching and how close we are because their attention was on the left hand side as they're reversing towards the left onto that driveway at the end of the road left [Music] Simon does hold back at a good distance and before moving off she checks her mirrors and stares nicely around the silver car making sure not to get too close [Music] as we got to the end of this road to turn left there was a gap before the bus most experienced drivers would definitely take the scap as the bus is on a 20 miles per hour road but Simon decides to wait for them now this didn't necessarily go down as a fault because we couldn't see because of the biker to,224.7,305.699,911,189,LkN7Tp8TbD4,1499,https://youtu.be/LkN7Tp8TbD4?t=224,
the right Simon does tuck into the left-hand Lane really nicely but once in the new road as she's trying to change gears she does drift over the white line so control and coordination is a little bit off when trying to do the gear changes [Music],307.74,325.24,246,52,LkN7Tp8TbD4,1499,https://youtu.be/LkN7Tp8TbD4?t=307,
take the next Road on your right there's a hazard on the right hand side of the road and the Little Bus approaching decides to overtake now there is enough space to fit but it is a little bit tight Simon's going through a well but then gets a serious fault because she turns the wheel to the right as we're crossing the back of the bus so we're turning right [Music] so Simon was initially going through the space well and then tilts to the right as the bus is passing she needed to keep the wheels straight foreign traffic and clearance is definitely a weakness and this is something I had addressed with Simon before we started this mock so she knew this is something that we are definitely looking out for on these roads all over and park up on the left please don't worry about the driveways on this occasion [Music] drive off when you're ready foreign,347.58,426.06,856,174,LkN7Tp8TbD4,1499,https://youtu.be/LkN7Tp8TbD4?t=347,
[Music] term right Simon's got a good position in the middle of the road and she does move back into the left at the t-junction but she stops over the giveaway line before she's looked right had slime I looked both ways before crossing the giveaway line if the road was clear it would not have been a serious fault but you should always look right left right at least once before you cross the giveaway line [Music] going straight ahead here Sima gets a dangerous Fault With The Pedestrian that's in the road she needed to move well away from The Pedestrian in order to give them some clearance as the man was just standing in the road if there was oncoming traffic then we would have had to stop in this scenario so I mean you need to give the man some space okay slow down a little bit [Music] so just slow down a little bit [Music],442.12,516.039,834,179,LkN7Tp8TbD4,1499,https://youtu.be/LkN7Tp8TbD4?t=442,
and if you could just park up on the left behind this blue car okay leave enough space to move away just go slowly don't worry about the driveway keep it rolling keep going forward a bit more and about there is fine yeah thank you don't worry about the driveway secure the car push the handbrake yeah it's it's not on there you go you have to hear that noise yeah and that red light should be on okay how was your drive good it's going really well yes mirror's signal positioning good there are some key points we need to work on uh like a roundabout I checked little right one mistake this one the roundabouts hello I'm asking no they're wrong yeah the roundabouts are fine okay um okay what it is is you see how that man was standing in the road yeah and uh I need the space because he's just kind of doing his own thing what if he opens the door and stands backwards you you need to leave more clearance around your,532.98,594.06,918,194,LkN7Tp8TbD4,1499,https://youtu.be/LkN7Tp8TbD4?t=532,
car and that's kind of the main thing with everything the whole drive it was just that was a little bit little bit you know we could fix it a little bit more okay the rest was definitely good it was really good so like the positioning the way you were driving yeah looking so let's just okay let me just mention all the bits where we could improve a little bit so right from the beginning okay yes so when we started he moves off very nicely t-junction positioned very nicely roundabout looking really nicely and going straight okay on that new road there was a van who was giving you away yeah yeah you put the clutch down and we're going downhill it went a bit faster try not to put the clutch down first because that makes you go yeah that makes you go faster then there was that black car that was reversing yes on the driveway yeah yeah yeah you should have stayed in the middle you kind of went towards the black car okay you David you should wait but don't when,596.279,647.64,968,195,LkN7Tp8TbD4,1499,https://youtu.be/LkN7Tp8TbD4?t=596,
you're waiting don't go so close to people okay so you're eating into the distance yeah maintain a nice clearance so whenever you're driving try and maintain a nice space around your vehicle you keep getting getting close to kind of somebody here somebody's car there a little bit so we could improve on that oh good okay okay the rest is good definitely spent it's almost time on me so I I don't want to oh no no don't think about it like that there was a good drive we just need to make sure that if somebody gets too close to you I need to you just slow down yeah take take care with the space don't just keep going because they're pushing go slower oh look we had that bus overtaking the other bus we're on the main road yes yeah on the main roadway we had the bus overtaking yeah yeah you've carried on you should have slowed down because the space is a little narrow yeah um and mainly back there clearance again it was mainly just clearance really I,650.64,710.22,956,199,LkN7Tp8TbD4,1499,https://youtu.be/LkN7Tp8TbD4?t=650,
know we break this two three times um uh stop on the left side too much yeah no that's fine we will so take care when you're driving with your space around Don't Go Near other people too much two foreign I also feel I didn't park well you can see he was parked a bit funny turn left here [Music] good okay should we go back to doing it mock test style but I'll help you if need beer okay okay [Music] all right at the end turn left [Music],712.019,785.24,439,102,LkN7Tp8TbD4,1499,https://youtu.be/LkN7Tp8TbD4?t=712,
this is 40. from there think about this van foreign do we need to stop just checking my roots just slow down but there's space for both but make sure you're checking your mirrors so you're not just stopping randomly [Music] oh stop that stop it stop that Simon don't turn your hands like that otherwise you're going to hit this corner here and Signal the direction you're going [Music] so we want both lanes to be clear okay because when you come out we naturally swing is it clear yes yeah we can yeah and stay on this one lovely yeah and it's 40 you said yeah yeah okay so we're gonna try and get to 40. yes yep a little bit faster if you can come on a bit more speed here a bit more don't move that way though cyber good and what else are we doing tonight yeah [Music] very nice anything else pants none of this nice and steady you okay yes just the bit where we stopped for that man,826.8,930.54,886,197,LkN7Tp8TbD4,1499,https://youtu.be/LkN7Tp8TbD4?t=826,
we don't want to because it was like a quick random sort of stop [Music] we need to just share the space a bit better I would suggest you move into the middle Lane we're going to be on this road for a little bit longer [Music] yeah we need to make sure we're not too slow otherwise no one's going to let you in yes it's okay but we're still going to make sure we're making progress as well can we go now yeah well how do we steer how do we change lanes of the steering wheel should we turn that off don't pull the steering like that next time okay the space was there yeah slower [Music] I want you to make sure when you're trying to change lanes that you're not kind of checking and slowing down because then it's harder for them to give you weight [Music] yeah is it clear yes okay keep tracking now think about how you're changing leads foreign [Music],931.56,1017.33,855,191,LkN7Tp8TbD4,1499,https://youtu.be/LkN7Tp8TbD4?t=931,

and then go afterwards now in terms of the drive on the smaller roads we were talking about just kind of having more space around yes which was better we're gonna keep that in mind for next time generally it was good the parking's definitely got better yes yeah this was nice um the slip Road yes that was very good the 40 yes I just had to prompt you a little bit there so I had to say Simon what do we have to do and you were like oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so next time I want to say nothing you I have to do you have to just remember yes you will have my voice playing in your head yes yes um changing lanes that was okay you went a little slow but it was okay um the roundabout where we did the left turn on to yedding that was very good but you just kind of went four and four okay but that wasn't an issue because by the time you stopped you went into gear one okay um your speed on approach to those,1386.179,1433.4,908,198,LkN7Tp8TbD4,1499,https://youtu.be/LkN7Tp8TbD4?t=1386,
roundabouts was so much better so there was a big Improvement on the control side which is what we've been working on so I'm happy with that and even on the roundabouts yeah following the lines yes so much nicer and you were checking my cell phone don't don't left the line don't love the lane keep in your lane that's it Go the wrong way okay so yeah definitely an improvement but yeah we need to make sure that you don't dwell on anything okay so when we were driving in the bus lane and I think you said something and I think I said traffic lights left but then you started moving this way and then you were going close to the van and I said no no we'll talk about this later yeah do this yes so yeah it's kind of the same same pattern because we don't need to think try and forget about what happened because in other words you're gonna make more mistakes because of it Focus yeah but it's definitely a lot better,1434.9,1479.0,917,194,LkN7Tp8TbD4,1499,https://youtu.be/LkN7Tp8TbD4?t=1434,
so I'm going to see if we can move the test back but um it's definitely going in the right direction we might just need a little bit more time all right yeah all right well that's the end of our video today hopefully it's been useful you guys like watching Simon's progress so thank you for all your support thank you [Music],1480.5,1497.21,325,70,LkN7Tp8TbD4,1499,https://youtu.be/LkN7Tp8TbD4?t=1480,
it's all right [Music] okay you got controls [Music] 300 years right on the roundabout [Music] s foreign guys welcome back to Clearview driving my name is Amin and today I'm doing a mock test with violet now you've got your driving test coming up in a few weeks time and this is our first official mock test and from a complete beginner we've done about 23 hours of practice and you do kind of practice a little bit outside of lessons as well very little bit yeah very little how's that been going with your mum not very well drive with driving with parents is definitely always harder because uh I think they probably make you a little bit anxious because they don't know how to control the car if anything goes wrong yeah that's a difficult bit and this is the first block test I don't expect it to be perfect if you feel like you've made a mistake don't dwell on it okay all right so throughout the drive,2.12,76.38,907,193,4wO7tK35AJA,1459,https://youtu.be/4wO7tK35AJA?t=2,
I'm going to get you to follow the road ahead whenever I need you to turn I will tell you but for the first sort of 15-20 minutes I am going to get you to just follow the sat nav and then I'll give you instructions as normal when that finishes okay we're gonna do one maneuver we may also do the emergency stop just drive safely that's the main criteria okay all right so before we get started I'm going to ask you a quick question about your vehicle could you tell me how would you check that your indicators are working um by asking someone to stand behind the car and you put them on there okay and how do you put them on lift up to go left sorry lift up to go right and lift down together okay that's fine or you can put the houses on right yeah okay so yeah that works as well okay so for anyone that's new to watching these videos don't forget to like the video comment down below what you think um subscribe if you've not already and,78.78,130.38,940,201,4wO7tK35AJA,1459,https://youtu.be/4wO7tK35AJA?t=78,

today's mock test is a prime example of why it's really important to carry out mock test style driving with family or with your instructor now Violet is a really capable driver and knows what she's doing but as soon as we started mock test she was getting nervous and overthinking scenarios which she normally wouldn't think twice about [Music] turn right then turn left,167.64,197.459,370,72,4wO7tK35AJA,1459,https://youtu.be/4wO7tK35AJA?t=167,
[Music] foreign [Music] a driving test can be very stressful so it's always a good idea to do a mock test with your instructor as examiners are only there to observe you you don't want your first experience of driving on your own to be on your driving test in my experience as an instructor students generally make a lot of mistakes on their first and second mock tests they improve immensely with this technique as they learn to deal with hazards and gain more experience with practice safe at the end of the road just anywhere along here [Music] foreign [Music],219.51,274.72,563,113,4wO7tK35AJA,1459,https://youtu.be/4wO7tK35AJA?t=219,
approach to that last stop we did go slightly over the raised curb but this was not a major fault as there were no pedestrians about and we only went over briefly but Violet should have slowed down a lot more and come in more gradually turn left foreign,292.5,310.86,253,50,4wO7tK35AJA,1459,https://youtu.be/4wO7tK35AJA?t=292,
[Music] after 200 yards go right on the roundabout and take the third exit [Music] go right on the roundabout and take the third exit [Music] sorry it's all right [Music] you okay yeah now Violet would normally never take this sort of Gap but at this point she was overthinking it and didn't want to get marked down for hesitation so decided to move forward thank you turn left then turn right [Music] turn right then at the end of the road turn left [Music] driving along this road while it gets a serious fault with clearance with the last parked car on the left turn left you don't move away okay you got controls yeah yeah take off okay back to you so initially Violet was in the middle of the road but as we're getting closer to the end she started drifting towards the black car and we would have hit the car foreign Park up on the left along here don't worry about the driveways on this occasion,347.71,507.9,902,194,4wO7tK35AJA,1459,https://youtu.be/4wO7tK35AJA?t=347,
not too close here all right drive up again when you're ready [Music] foreign [Music] as we're moving our position throughout this road it's always a good idea to be checking your mirrors in the direction you're moving so if you're moving towards the right you should check top and right and moving towards the left check top and left [Music] but at the end of this road we're actually making a right turn the sat nav slightly incorrect at this point as it has been raining it's not safe to drive fully up to the speed of the road navala is still within the speed limit but we are driving a little bit fast it would be safer to drive a little bit slower so that we have more time to react to hazards this can be a difficult Junction to try and cross as the traffic on the main road is constant so we need to make sure we keep checking both sides to try and clear it in one go but if it's too busy,511.099,605.16,896,193,4wO7tK35AJA,1459,https://youtu.be/4wO7tK35AJA?t=511,
then you can wait for the right hand side of the road to clear and then move halfway Violet does deal with this Junction carefully by only inching forward when the road is clear even if you've moved out halfway and someone turns up afterwards keep checking both sides and try and establish eye contact with the traffic on the main road [Music],607.56,627.84,343,67,4wO7tK35AJA,1459,https://youtu.be/4wO7tK35AJA?t=607,

thank you all right if you can just turn right into any one of these yeah to turn into any one of these all right what I'd like you to do now is I would like you to forward park into a space of your choice make sure you finish within the white lines of the parking Bay naturally with the forward parking exercise you do swing into the second space so make sure there's at least two spaces empty and park in the first of the two oh hello sorry,726.18,762.36,442,93,4wO7tK35AJA,1459,https://youtu.be/4wO7tK35AJA?t=726,
okay yeah can I take control yeah can I ask you a quick question yeah why are you going into the one space where there's a car there why not go over there well there's nobody around you I don't know because suddenly I realize I've gone too far and I just thought I just had to turn into one of them I could have come round all right so do you want to give it another go yeah so okay it's fine I've got this you got this okay,782.48,815.339,424,96,4wO7tK35AJA,1459,https://youtu.be/4wO7tK35AJA?t=782,

just to give you a heads up the lane on the right is closed at the moment so you don't need to move over just yet can you see the roadwork signs yeah yeah as there are signs showing that the right hand lane will be obstructed in the distance Violet should have been aware that the traffic in the right hand lane will be merging back into the left she gets a serious fault for awareness and planning as she gets too close to a vehicle merging in [Music] no but you could see what was going on ahead of them all right back to you [Music],953.82,1000.56,535,115,4wO7tK35AJA,1459,https://youtu.be/4wO7tK35AJA?t=953,

thank you [Music] after 100 yards as we're turning right third exit on this roundabout we needed to switch into the right most Lane as soon as we enter the roundabout Violet goes into the third lane which is actually directing us straight ahead on the roundabout you know what you're doing we're going to just at this point we are in the lane to go straight ahead if the road is clear and you've checked your mirrors and it's nice and safe you can simply switch lanes and still make the right turn while it deals with this mistake really well by checking her mirrors and switching back to the left and staying calm going the wrong way in a driving test will not be counted as a fault as long as you're going according to the road markings so always try and stay relaxed if you know you headed the wrong way just continue safely 100 yards then turn around when possible turn left then turn around when plus the traffic lights turn right,1063.44,1132.74,935,189,4wO7tK35AJA,1459,https://youtu.be/4wO7tK35AJA?t=1063,
turn around when possible then at the end of the road make a YouTube then go left on the roundabout and take the first exit [Music] so I'm just going to give you instructions as normal from now on okay [Music] if you could pull it in park up on the left hand side in that space system [Music],1134.48,1181.45,292,67,4wO7tK35AJA,1459,https://youtu.be/4wO7tK35AJA?t=1134,
and switch off the engine all right that's the end of the office so I'm going to finish up the test a bit earlier because uh there was a lot going on yeah it was it was interesting okay so it was the first ever mock test and I've never kind of left you in times like this where you kind of just have to deal with it yeah yeah believe it or not guys I've never had to take control in our lessons but the traffic was a lot heavier wasn't it yeah that but also like it's more the spit I'm worried that I'm not going early enough because like sometimes I wait for so long yeah and I'm worried that I should have gone and now I've just waited too long so I just tried to go so like with that roundabout yeah I was like oh my gosh I haven't got and then she hesitated so I was like oh I've got to go now and I know I should have just left it afterwards yeah it's,1199.46,1254.48,856,197,4wO7tK35AJA,1459,https://youtu.be/4wO7tK35AJA?t=1199,
just like I got too stressed yeah you don't want to overthink it and then that roundabout was I meant to get the answer inside Lane yeah yeah I thought so because you had the right arrow in that thing wouldn't you didn't you I just got confused and follow the car in front of me okay going the wrong way that was absolutely okay okay yeah you've got to stay calm yeah but um how was it kind of knowing that I'm just kind of doing everything on my own did that kind of eat at you a little bit yeah it wasn't like the driving of the decision making which I know is like just everything I was like wait should I be doing this or that I don't know yeah so that stressed her out a little bit Yeah because no when we got into that car park and I said I'll forward Bay Park there's like empty spaceshore Park here you went all the way between the cars I was like no don't do that,1256.16,1300.919,872,193,4wO7tK35AJA,1459,https://youtu.be/4wO7tK35AJA?t=1256,
um thinking of the main ones there were a few clearance when you've got to know that black yeah car on the left yeah is it because we had a large van on the other side it must have been yeah I didn't even notice that one until you said it yeah I had to stop you because you were extremely close I just thought let me just show you rather than letting you slide through because it just didn't feel like nice at all and the senses went off anyways uh there was one more that I'm thinking oh okay the black car you said oh he's just pushing in yeah but like I was not listening because I didn't I was like what you said I didn't see is indicator until he was in front of me no no okay I get that but on the left-hand side of the road did you see those signs yeah okay so that at that point um there was some cones laid out because the barrier in the middle would was broken somebody probably crashed into it so they're forced into your lane and he was,1303.679,1357.2,948,204,4wO7tK35AJA,1459,https://youtu.be/4wO7tK35AJA?t=1303,
indicating he's waiting um and they'd done had that indicator on for some time so you just needed to kind of look at the bigger picture I think you were just kind of focused on your lane yeah but yeah it's okay this is all a learning experience you want to pick up from these mistakes and know better for next time yeah we have got plenty of time so don't worry but um yeah this was a bit of a challenging route before we started I gave Violet a choice of four numbers and I said pick a number and you picked your number and that was the route that we took which I'd say it definitely was the most challenging from the fall and what about the you know like the junction where I came out and it was oh okay with that one right it was a busy road yeah you had to go out slowly when the cars on your right were turning in like especially with two of them turning in you tried to go out with the van but you,1359.12,1402.86,903,192,4wO7tK35AJA,1459,https://youtu.be/4wO7tK35AJA?t=1359,
should have gone up slightly earlier and then the other car would have waited by the time you were going out the second car is now nearly there so we should just wait but you dealt with it safely so it wasn't like a major fault or anything but just because it's so busy keep watching both sides and one side's clear go out the first half or if the the first car in second car returning then go out but go out cautiously yeah but yeah you did that by the end so there was nothing to be alarmed about but yeah that's the end of our mock test video today short and sweet but honestly I never have to take control in our lessons normally I think it's just because I'm totally just leaving you in charge of it which we're going to be doing more and more yeah because we have kind of started mock test driving but we haven't gone for the full full mock test we're just on your own yeah and that's what today was about it's okay you're gonna learn from this so don't worry,1404.6,1452.419,965,205,4wO7tK35AJA,1459,https://youtu.be/4wO7tK35AJA?t=1404,

foreign [Music] guys welcome back to Clearview driving my name is Ammon and today we have another mock test with Chez hello hello he is back all right so you've reviewed the video yeah and you've done some work yeah and now you're back to about redeem yourself to redeem myself that was abysmal okay now you've still got about another 10 days or so before your actual test um what day is it today about yeah about around 10 days yeah okay so the main idea today again is for you to hopefully drive and do everything independently and not make any serious faults and if so you'll at least have some time before your test yeah all right okay you know the drill whenever I needed a turn I'll tell you if not continue following the road ahead if you're not sure where you're going you can always ask okay all right one maneuver maybe the emergency stop okay okay all right so before we get started I'm going to ask you a quick,33.239,90.9,922,194,HPBjGiNEWIA,1964,https://youtu.be/HPBjGiNEWIA?t=33,
question about your vehicle all right could you tell me about the general condition of your tires to be roadworthy so it has to be 1.6 in tread depth and as I have no Cuts or Borges okay sounds good all right so when it be ready you can start the engine and for anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe if you've not already so I'm ready when you're ready,92.46,113.24,411,92,HPBjGiNEWIA,1964,https://youtu.be/HPBjGiNEWIA?t=92,
don't miss any chance [Music] okay when we get to the end of this road um right when dealing with pedestrians at Junctions like this you want to give way if The Pedestrian is approaching or waiting at the end of the road as we're going to stop in front of them and block their path in this case you can see chess goes forward and the girl starts to cross the road behind us and the vehicle on the opposite side doesn't see her approaching so it would have been safer to just wait for the girl to cross the road in front and then get to the end of the road now chess is not going to get marked down for this as The Pedestrian was waiting but it would have been safer to give way foreign from a signed Road into a main road and the main road is fairly busy so at first we had to carry on waiting as there wasn't a space to enter but when the right hand side of the road is clear,138.3,198.72,876,192,HPBjGiNEWIA,1964,https://youtu.be/HPBjGiNEWIA?t=138,
even with the traffic flowing on the left-hand side you can go halfway but emerge out slowly now once you're out halfway the opposite side tends to give way you can go wrong way [Music] isn't running back,200.58,243.42,204,43,HPBjGiNEWIA,1964,https://youtu.be/HPBjGiNEWIA?t=200,

okay now at the roundabout I'd like you to turn left it's the first exit as we're traveling on a 30 miles per hour road you want to aim to indicate about eight to ten car lengths before the turn chairs is indicating a little bit later but it's not enough to be a fault you want to make sure everyone knows where you're going in good time [Music],304.68,325.35,345,78,HPBjGiNEWIA,1964,https://youtu.be/HPBjGiNEWIA?t=304,
this is a 30 miles per hour road but there are speed bumps throughout this road as a traffic calming measure in the distance there are parked vehicles on both sides chairs does slow down but we should have slowed down some more as the space was fairly narrow [Music] if you could pull over and park up on the left anywhere safe along this road okay [Music] thank you that's great there drive off whenever you're ready as soon as you put on your indicator to move off make sure you're actually ready to move off in this case the vehicle behind us started to flash their lights and actually slow down for us now chairs reacted really quickly to this and moved off but when you're not ready to move off don't indicate straight away [Music] at the roundabout turn left is the first exit [Music] thank you [Music] the wrong way no all right we're going to start some independent driving now I'm going to give you a series of directions to,359.94,477.78,933,194,HPBjGiNEWIA,1964,https://youtu.be/HPBjGiNEWIA?t=359,
follow when we get to the first roundabouts and right and get to the next round about to turn right again the first roundabout right yep second round [Music],478.979,491.34,157,34,HPBjGiNEWIA,1964,https://youtu.be/HPBjGiNEWIA?t=478,
when it comes to clearance with part Vehicles you want to make sure you're not going up to the park vehicle and then moving towards the middle as soon as you see a part vehicle you want to try and leave at least two car lengths of clearance in front and you want to be in the middle of the road from that distance if you feel like you don't have that space available then you need to go through the space slower so the smaller the space the slower you go and then the lower the gear as well chess keeps going too close to the back corner of the vehicle and then moving towards the middle getting marked down for clearance [Music] foreign [Music],528.54,576.08,645,132,HPBjGiNEWIA,1964,https://youtu.be/HPBjGiNEWIA?t=528,
foreign has definitely improved from his first mock test where he was approaching Junctions too fast he's definitely controlling his speed a lot more now just needs to start indicating earlier chess is currently following signs towards chertsey which is right on the next roundabout he gets a serious fault with response to road marking as he goes into the left only lane and makes a right turn [Music] foreign [Music] this is a 30 miles per hour road and the bridge is fairly narrow two cars can pass alongside each other fairly easily but when a larger vehicle turns up you should slow down so passing alongside the bus on the opposite side chairs should have break to get control [Music],614.66,681.14,690,134,HPBjGiNEWIA,1964,https://youtu.be/HPBjGiNEWIA?t=614,
an approach to the traffic like junction ahead chess gets a serious fault with response to Road markings as he goes over the stop line and then stops the right hand lane has an early stop line so that the traffic turning in from the left can turn in easily foreign all the traffic coming in from the left is passing us fairly close but if a larger vehicle like a lorry or a bus had turned up they would have been unable to make this turn due to our position so it's really important to always stop behind the solid line [Music],719.82,752.08,527,107,HPBjGiNEWIA,1964,https://youtu.be/HPBjGiNEWIA?t=719,
in the distance the road is bending towards the right and there are two Junctions on the left hand side chest gets marked down for use of mirrors change speed as he slowed down unnecessarily and ends up waiting for the traffic even though he's on the main road and had priority [Music] it didn't get marked down as a serious fault as he didn't stop for very long and he did break gradually [Music] we're no longer following signs [Music],785.459,829.59,437,92,HPBjGiNEWIA,1964,https://youtu.be/HPBjGiNEWIA?t=785,
as we're going further down the road the road is getting Tighter and with parked vehicles on the road there's no longer enough space for two cars to pass at the same time chess gets a serious fault with the park van on the left hand side [Music],852.36,866.34,245,53,HPBjGiNEWIA,1964,https://youtu.be/HPBjGiNEWIA?t=852,

at this point Chaz was trying to be safe by waiting for the roundabout to clear before continuing as you can see the silver car in the roundabout is waiting and we can cross their path in front and get out the roundabout he carries on waiting even with the second car leaving the space for him to continue ahead he gets a serious fault for this [Music] okay,971.16,1003.68,357,75,HPBjGiNEWIA,1964,https://youtu.be/HPBjGiNEWIA?t=971,

[Music] foreign [Music] don't worry because the whole thing's empty anyways yeah okay all right how was your drive today uh I think it was bad in the last one but I know I know there's a few hairy moments there was one bit where you got so close to a gray van on the left I was oh you said it yourself you're like I should have slowed down I should have stopped you know I think there's like a white Prius plus and I I the angle is that I felt like if I went two in oh if you want any and further that Wing mirror was game yeah yeah so but you should have been anticipating part like cars coming down that road yeah can I tell you something you actually took the wrong route and you went down that road we weren't even meant to go down there we were meant to follow this road round there was like a Bend to the right and you kind of just stopped and you took a,1665.85,1736.22,860,190,HPBjGiNEWIA,1964,https://youtu.be/HPBjGiNEWIA?t=1665,
left turn oh so we ended up going the wrong way and that mistake happened oh so if I went the right way yeah but even before that there was like a little moment where you know where we were following signs to chertsey and chertsey was like two o'clock on the right um on the floor on the lead up to this roundabout there's a left only and a right only you've positioned in the left only and made a right turn so road marking okay that was just before you know that large vehicles in front of us and we really couldn't see very much just before that point um you were definitely driving a lot better than the last time but yeah there's still a few bits you want to work on um another thing with the indicator I know you want to turn on your indicator for your right turns and then switch it off but all these roundabouts when we turn at the roundabout and we straighten the wheel it's gonna click off okay so a lot of,1738.14,1782.84,916,197,HPBjGiNEWIA,1964,https://youtu.be/HPBjGiNEWIA?t=1738,
the times as you're coming off the roundabouts I feel like your attention's on trying to turn the indicator off and then you have a bit of sway after the round but just get out the roundabout and then if it's still on then turn it off yeah oh yeah your signal timed there's a few roundabouts where we're signaling quite late like if you can see the roundabouts right there we're approaching them it said 20 30. try and put your signal on about six to eight columns before okay you kind of you're about two colors before the roundabout and now you're putting it on and nobody was really affected by this but just put your signal on earlier but there was a hesitation for you know what we went to that roundabout and there was traffic built up yeah why didn't you go through that so I knew I felt like I should have went through that Gap but I thought cars approaching the right yeah but they're standing they're waiting aren't they yeah so just,1785.179,1831.2,943,200,HPBjGiNEWIA,1964,https://youtu.be/HPBjGiNEWIA?t=1785,
kind of look both ways that where they're going there's traffic so eye contact with those drivers and go in yeah yeah because the second lady she sat there waiting for you she was looking at us and you just sat there and I was like okay we can go now yeah okay yeah there's one of those ones where you know they're not going anywhere they're leaving you space get through and in terms of you know like what happened on the right at the very beginning when there's a busy road and you need to make a turn when one side of the road is clear you need to go halfway because otherwise you're going to be waiting for a while for the whole thing I thought I wasn't allowed to people why not that's what they said they said when there's a line like that a t-junction wait behind the line until you have a free space don't repeat because it's okay what would you normally do if you were driving on your own I'll peek of,1833.12,1875.539,910,195,HPBjGiNEWIA,1964,https://youtu.be/HPBjGiNEWIA?t=1833,
course yeah and what's wrong with that is that are you moving in front of someone no then every time you're making these decisions I want you to think what would I do if I was driving on my own just is that safe to do this then yeah do it I feel like I was way better than the last time than that I feel like it's definitely better than last time but there are a few hairy moments the clearance thing honestly that was that was really quite bad you know when that car came up and you knew it straight away yeah but yeah um I want you to try and get down to second gear a little bit sooner and you know there's a roundabout coming up okay now going forward from this we will be doing a driving lesson which probably won't be recording anyways but we're gonna do a driving lesson and I want to iron out some of these things with you and then that way you can go forward into your test in there yeah be successful with it let's do it let's do it okay,1877.1,1923.179,947,203,HPBjGiNEWIA,1964,https://youtu.be/HPBjGiNEWIA?t=1877,
all right guys that's the end of the test he's done the pressure is crazy because little stuff like that in a lesson I'll be like yeah easy but then as soon as you're in the test oh and when we entered in here why was I on YouTube I said to you we're gonna go left and then immediately left into the car park I don't know why I was in YouTube I thought I could I I didn't know it would be that sharp of a turn I'm just silly I knew I knew it yeah did you have to use a pedal no but I was just very very close yeah too close yeah all right well that's the end of the book test [Music],1925.1,1962.62,583,139,HPBjGiNEWIA,1964,https://youtu.be/HPBjGiNEWIA?t=1925,

foreign [Music] driving my name is Simon and today I'm doing a mock test with it and now this is the first time we are driving together and your test is next week how are you feeling nervous now you've never done a mock test before have you now he's done around 14 hours of driving lessons in a manual car and around two hours of practice outside of your lessons but in an automatic rate so not a lot of practice but um yeah we did a little bit of a drive on the way here but um yeah okay so do you know what's involved in a mock test you want me to tell you how it's going to go okay so I'm going to get you to follow the site map for the first 15-20 minutes or so and then I'm going to give you normal instructions thereafter we're going to do one maneuver and we may also carry out the emergency stop throughout the drive follow the road ahead if I'm not saying anything okay,32.099,87.24,878,194,-aM_Yt-zLe0,1585,https://youtu.be/-aM_Yt-zLe0?t=32,
all right so before we get started I'm going to ask you a question about your vehicle could you tell me how would you check that your head restraint is correctly adjusted I know they don't move in this car but how would you generally check so straight and then move your head back and check your face and next to your head that sounds fine all right so I'm ready whenever you're ready for anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below and subscribe if you haven't already and this is love just friend as you can see he is as quiet as loved it so yeah let's see how this goes hi guys welcome back to another mock test sorry about the technical glitch at the beginning of this video the rest of the video is as normal as you'd expect now Gogan hasn't actually made any minor Mistakes by this point and he's simply following the slap nav and the SAT nav's telling him to go straight ahead he was,89.52,139.5,929,194,-aM_Yt-zLe0,1585,https://youtu.be/-aM_Yt-zLe0?t=89,
super nervous but he is doing well so continue watching to see how he gets on after two months after 200 yards exit A3 now we're approaching this roundabout to follow the road ahead which is the second exit Gogan is in the left-hand Lane and that's the ideal Lane to do the roundabouting as we get a bit closer he switches into the right hand lane which does make it harder to exit [Music] across the roundabout and take the second exit A310 [Music] thank you [Music] as we exit the roundabout there is only one lane to take that exit which would be the left lane so we're going to have to switch lanes in the roundabout to get towards our exit,141.84,199.62,644,144,-aM_Yt-zLe0,1585,https://youtu.be/-aM_Yt-zLe0?t=141,
the roundabout is fairly busy and we are crossing two lanes on this dual carriageway Gogan waits for a safe Gap but as he enters he enters too slowly you need to make sure you accelerate quite firm and delay the gear change as this will help you speed up foreign [Music],217.86,242.16,270,59,-aM_Yt-zLe0,1585,https://youtu.be/-aM_Yt-zLe0?t=217,
foreign [Music] and you're asked to pull over and Park The Examiner would have usually identified a space for you to be able to park up if there's any traffic around you or any Junctions around be sure to signal that you're parking and signal that you're moving off after 200 yards turn right b361 this Junction is on a Bend so we have to move round towards the left to make the right turn goggin does go into the middle but his front right side of the car is a bit too close to the center line if a large vehicle had turned up going around that bend they would have been too close to our vehicle and possibly collided so you want to be mindful of how traffic on the opposite side of the road would be flowing,269.16,321.419,709,151,-aM_Yt-zLe0,1585,https://youtu.be/-aM_Yt-zLe0?t=269,
as we're waiting in this position the tires are currently facing towards the right so if any vehicle passes us quite close or if we Lurch forward we're going to go into the right hand side of the road we should wait more towards the left so that we're in the center of this space thank you as we're waiting in this position we would either go when the road ahead is visibly clear and we have a gap or when the traffic light in front of us which is currently green starts changing to Red now the traffic light did start changing but the traffic from the left was still coming through although it was red Sovereign had to keep waiting until the traffic in front clears But be sure to clear the junction quickly [Music],346.02,390.79,716,145,-aM_Yt-zLe0,1585,https://youtu.be/-aM_Yt-zLe0?t=346,
foreign [Music] sometimes stalling the engine may actually be a blessing in disguise and that's exactly what happened here Gogan was waiting for a safeguard to enter and thinks it's safe and tries to emerge and stalls straight away had he taken that Gap it would have gone down as a serious if not a dangerous fault as there was a vehicle approaching slightly further but at speed so always make sure you can see the road right the way down and wait for a safe Gap,408.12,448.08,464,93,-aM_Yt-zLe0,1585,https://youtu.be/-aM_Yt-zLe0?t=408,
foreign [Music] really confidently along this carriageway but at this point the sat nav hasn't given any instructions with what we're doing next but you can see with the diagram that we are going to be making a right turn on the roundabout Sega notices this in good time and switches into the right hand lane go right on the roundabout and take the third exit b358 towards Whitman as we enter this roundabout Gogan does do the turn really nicely but he's not indicating so the vehicle behind us doesn't realize we're making a right turn [Music],475.199,531.43,544,116,-aM_Yt-zLe0,1585,https://youtu.be/-aM_Yt-zLe0?t=475,
foreign as we're already in the left-hand Lane it is clear that we're heading towards the exit but you should put on a left indicator as the signal may be helpful for pedestrians and other vehicles [Music],547.2,560.61,205,42,-aM_Yt-zLe0,1585,https://youtu.be/-aM_Yt-zLe0?t=547,
that blue light shouldn't be on just pull it towards you [Music] as we get to the end of this road the left hand side of the road is fairly open and we can see it quite well whereas the right hand side you can't see until quite late Gogan looks really well towards the left but doesn't pay much attention towards the right always make sure you look right left right and pay more attention towards the right if a vehicle is approaching they'll come towards you from the right hand side first he's looking towards the right was prompted by me looking [Music] the point that Gogan does look right if a vehicle had been approaching we would have been approaching the junction too fast causing them to slow down and swerve or even just breaking really harsh to make that stop you want to make sure you've got a clear view if not then you should be approaching slower [Music] an approach to any zebra Crossing always step off the accelerator and scan both,582.839,660.3,949,193,-aM_Yt-zLe0,1585,https://youtu.be/-aM_Yt-zLe0?t=582,
sides as this is where pedestrians have priority on approach to the next Crossing Gogan does notice The Pedestrian a bit late but manages to stop just in time go left on the roundabout and take the first exit [Music],662.339,678.2,216,47,-aM_Yt-zLe0,1585,https://youtu.be/-aM_Yt-zLe0?t=662,
foreign [Music] gets marked down for clearance as the space is fairly narrow and a vehicle from the right hand side was passing fairly close so he should have slowed down some more or even considered stopping [Music] after 200 yards you have reached your destination on your left okay I'm going to give you instructions as normal from now on just keep following the road ahead [Music] it's roundabouts and break that exit [Music] asgen approaches these roundabouts and Junctions he should approach a little bit slower because as we're going through it happened to be clear but if a vehicle had been approaching he would have had to harsh break and stop [Music],701.94,769.92,660,133,-aM_Yt-zLe0,1585,https://youtu.be/-aM_Yt-zLe0?t=701,

and the roundabout turn left it's the first exit coming up to this meeting situation with this large vehicle on the opposite side of the road goggin gets a dangerous mistake with clearance as I had to take control there's a parked car on the right hand side of the road so Laurie moved closer to us and the Lorry was very fast foreign [Music] was approaching we should have been slowing down and because the Lorry was so fast we should have considered stopping [Music] that's fine thank you secure the car and switch off the engine if you just give me a few minutes hey David um how's your test I did a few mistakes and then look and I had to stop the emergency stop yeah what about it all the way didn't look around yeah yeah I forgot you remember I reminded you that earlier yeah okay so for a fast mock test there's not a lot of serious faults but there are quite a lot of miners so we,1149.36,1233.12,888,189,-aM_Yt-zLe0,1585,https://youtu.be/-aM_Yt-zLe0?t=1149,
need to cut down on those definitely um so unfortunately no it wouldn't be a pass now the main reason why it wouldn't be a pass is there's a few which I'm going to highlight for you so firstly the emergency stop after you've stopped in the middle of the road I've said do you think you could drive off and you simply yeah yeah definitely you need to look around okay we're in the middle of the road you need to check your blind spots like this and once you've stopped after an emergency stops to secure the car as well so you're not in a rush to get away the next thing was the way we approached that roundabout back there you know where we did that right turn there was like a gray Passat yeah there's a car for me right you waited for him but only just and then the town on the roundabouts quite fast wasn't it oh yeah that one yeah yeah so we approached that a bit too fast now with that Lorry just now why did I,1235.22,1284.78,915,200,-aM_Yt-zLe0,1585,https://youtu.be/-aM_Yt-zLe0?t=1235,
grab the wheel oh it's toothless yeah he was very fast wasn't he okay did you notice how fast and how close he was coming to you now as we're driving along there isn't much we can do but because he's coming in at that speed close to you you needed to at least slow down and move left you're carrying on on as normal and I've had to grab the wheel there because he would have honestly hit that Wing mirror if I didn't take control okay so even if it's someone else's fault we need to yeah be a bit more defensive how was the rest of the drive how are the how are the roundabouts in the first half I didn't get that now go the part oh emergency stop part that's when I start doing more mistakes oh yeah after that we definitely had more definitely okay so in the first half I felt like we got away with a lot of the minor faults because there wasn't a lot of traffic around us like you were being,1286.76,1340.34,894,197,-aM_Yt-zLe0,1585,https://youtu.be/-aM_Yt-zLe0?t=1286,
safe you're checking your mirrors and sorts but I felt like if we had a bit more going on or the traffic around us was a bit faster we could have had a few faults on the first half as well so there's a few I want to talk about so firstly you know that roundabout where we were going straight you went into the right hand lane to go straight didn't you yeah do we need to be on the right no no we should have been on the left haven't we so you've started on the right and you you did check your mirrors you've signaled and everything but like I said if there was traffic on your left you would have now been panicking going oh where am I going yeah yeah and also the Gap that you took like it's a pretty small Gap but I feel like you need to start moving into these roundabouts with a bit more speed because that's a gap you can take but you've got to be quick with it so you'd normally see like experienced,1342.5,1387.08,906,199,-aM_Yt-zLe0,1585,https://youtu.be/-aM_Yt-zLe0?t=1342,
drivers going in for that sort of Gap yeah so you've got to be quick if you're gonna go otherwise don't go okay um you remember that other round but we were making like a left turn as we're about to go on the carriageway with the stadiums in front of us now you stalled there didn't you yeah okay you know if that's all there was honestly a blessing in disguise for you had you taken that Gap that would have been a serious fault because there was traffic coming in from the right on a 40 year old so even though it looked clear but as soon as you go in there's traffic that's slightly further but coming in at 40 like possibly yeah yeah so that wasn't an ideal Gap so I would honestly make sure that the road is completely clear the traffic is stopping before I take that Gap there because of the speed that they can come in okay um then we did a few stops and a few right turns on the roundabouts with the,1388.88,1438.44,907,197,-aM_Yt-zLe0,1585,https://youtu.be/-aM_Yt-zLe0?t=1388,
traffic light at least well there were no signals you weren't making use of your indicator as much as you probably did you realize you pulled up pulled up twice with no signal I don't know you did that right turn on the roundabout with no signal but because it was traffic like controlled it wasn't major but it definitely confused the guy behind because he didn't know what we're doing yeah you did the roundabout itself nicely but you need to tell everyone where you're going okay um yeah I just felt like we were a bit Lucky in the first half like that zebra Crossing man you stopped a bit late for him didn't you oh yeah yeah you told him but it was just like oh come on get there there was one really bad clearance right near that tight bendy bit near the High Street it was like a trucker on the right and you kind of dealt with it but you should have at least slowed down to make it easier if somebody squeezes into you if,1439.94,1486.559,929,195,-aM_Yt-zLe0,1585,https://youtu.be/-aM_Yt-zLe0?t=1439,
you're already in a tight Gap how do we deal with it slow down stop yeah just definitely slow down because then it'll give you more time to sort of Judge the space and then stop if necessary okay yeah I definitely felt like in the second half there were more mistakes going on I felt like the Junctions were a little quicker Parts yeah yeah but it's okay you've got enough time you can still work on these things so we're gonna go and work on some of these things now how do you feel about your mock test experience it was like scary doing everything independently oh there was that right turn as well do you remember that right turn near um Twickenham Stadium Station where we were on like a bit of a slant yeah yeah we're waiting there yeah the car was rolling a little bit but when you're waiting there your front right corner like that corner there it felt like it was exposed to the traffic passing because they're they're coming around a Bend aren't they,1488.84,1539.96,960,196,-aM_Yt-zLe0,1585,https://youtu.be/-aM_Yt-zLe0?t=1488,
I was just hoping that no buses turned from the left because if a bus had come along that that bit would be hit so you need to be wary of that I'll show you where that was because that was a bit um like you're still in your space but you're just closer to the right which means they're likely to scrape past your car because of the bend yeah do you know which bit I'm on about yeah the one next to Tesco yes that's the one the one near the college all right well that's the end of your mock test today thank you for everyone that has been watching hopefully this mock test has been useful for you guys as well but you've still got some time and let us know how the test goes okay he's a quiet one [Music],1541.46,1583.68,704,157,-aM_Yt-zLe0,1585,https://youtu.be/-aM_Yt-zLe0?t=1541,

foreign guys welcome back to Clearview driving my name is lamin and today we're doing a mock test with Simon now your tests coming up in about 10 days how are you feeling good confident yeah good glad to see it so today we're going to do a slightly different route yes um we have practice all around the area anyways but um I thought we'll try a full mock test start to finish yes and it's foggy outside today so good luck with that it's a bit more challenging than normal so be careful very less visibility that's it yeah so we'll have our fog lights on as well now for anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below subscribe and even select that Bell icon so that you get a notification every time that I upload um Simon was talking about the pleasant comments online because she obviously reads all of them and I think that's definitely helping you as well directly yeah which is always it is always really,32.099,92.1,946,192,yQ84-NHrgV8,1305,https://youtu.be/yQ84-NHrgV8?t=32,
nice so thank you guys thank you yes okay so we're ready to go yes okay I'm gonna get you to follow the stat nav okay yeah that's it foreign [Music] then take the second right arrive at your destination at 10 36 am as we got to the end of this road Simon needed to go into this corner and there was enough space to fit alongside the black car but it wasn't enough to be a fault at this point but she needed to make sure she follows the corner around as we came out of this Junction she does swing over the white line across the road [Music] the main objective of these mock tests is to get Simon driving independently and making decisions on her own even if she makes a mistake she needs to be able to deal with what's happening on the road independently this is a weakness at the moment when Simon knows she's made a mistake she tends to dwell on that mistake and that then affects everything else thereafter and this is definitely something that,94.38,183.54,947,196,yQ84-NHrgV8,1305,https://youtu.be/yQ84-NHrgV8?t=94,
we're working on at the moment [Music],185.22,186.95,38,10,yQ84-NHrgV8,1305,https://youtu.be/yQ84-NHrgV8?t=185,
when driving in foggy conditions if visibility is less than 100 meters be sure to use your fog lights after 200 yards turn right [Music],207.659,217.33,136,30,yQ84-NHrgV8,1305,https://youtu.be/yQ84-NHrgV8?t=207,
turn right this was the first time for Simon driving fully using the sat nav and she was a little bit confused with when the next turning is approaching when following directions from the sat nav be sure to look at the top bar across the sat nav as that will list the direction and also the distance to the direction so in this case Sima started indicating about 200 yards before the Turning you want to normally indicate around 100 yards from the entrance if you're driving a little bit faster than you can signal earlier [Music],232.5,263.82,530,104,yQ84-NHrgV8,1305,https://youtu.be/yQ84-NHrgV8?t=232,
turn left then go right on the roundabout and take the second exit,287.639,290.58,66,14,yQ84-NHrgV8,1305,https://youtu.be/yQ84-NHrgV8?t=287,
foreign [Music] s go right on the roundabout and take second exit then Bear right answer apart vehicles on the right hand side of the road cymer should have moved a little more left to make space for oncoming traffic through the middle of the road go right on the roundabout and take the second exit then they're right,307.259,333.539,318,66,yQ84-NHrgV8,1305,https://youtu.be/yQ84-NHrgV8?t=307,
they're right then turn left at times the sat nav tends to give two instructions very close together so in this case it says bear eye and then turn left so we're following the road to the right and then turning left this is something that Sima definitely found confusing at first but when you follow the blue line on the sat nav you can see where you're headed 127 [Music] turn left,359.82,383.759,382,80,yQ84-NHrgV8,1305,https://youtu.be/yQ84-NHrgV8?t=359,
[Music] 300 yards cross the roundabout and take the second exit a4127 towards Harrow [Music] cross the roundabout and take the second exit [Music] foreign works are blocking the left-hand Lane as we enter the roundabout Simon should check her mirrors towards left before moving left now she doesn't do this but nobody is there but this is where a motorbike can easily come up on your left as you move over so always check your mirrors when you enter around about to keep to your lane take the exit a4127 then take the second right Simon follows her Lane Round really nicely and we're in the best Lane to exit once we've exited the roundabout we needed to switch into the right hand lane as we had parked vehicles in our path Simon checks her mirrors but does not indicate it's very important to indicate at this point as vehicles on the right may not see the obstructions that are in your path second left [Music],410.14,502.22,913,192,yQ84-NHrgV8,1305,https://youtu.be/yQ84-NHrgV8?t=410,
so we're turning right in here turn right then take the second left [Music] and if you could pull over and park up on the left just before the gray card don't worry about the driveways on this occasion [Music] that's fine no thank you okay Simon what I'm going to ask you to do now is to use the vehicle in front to demonstrate how you would carry out the parallel park exercise so start next to the vehicle in the road then reverse back and finish within two car links and try not to go over the driveways treat that like a raised curb cover the okay yeah don't go on the driveways okay there to drive it no it does no no you can be in front of the driveway don't go on the drive okay,510.78,578.399,685,152,yQ84-NHrgV8,1305,https://youtu.be/yQ84-NHrgV8?t=510,

the exit then turn left [Music] turn left South then turn right [Music] foreign [Music] follows round head after 200 yards cross the roundabout and take the second exit then you have reached your destination at this point the sat nav is saying to go straight ahead and then we've reached the destination Slimer ends up making a right turn in this roundabout without a right signal going the wrong way is not a problem but you can't turn right on a roundabout without an indicator destination [Music] you have reached your destination [Music] destination [Music] turn left then you have reached the wrong side of the road okay all right you got it yeah oh what happened with this how was your test uh first I tell uh the brick or the yeah I I thought she's going there so I didn't see he's on the zebra yeah first at the second that now he's there I know yeah okay now let's talk about,866.7,1004.899,884,190,yQ84-NHrgV8,1305,https://youtu.be/yQ84-NHrgV8?t=866,
the test before the zebra Crossing how was it yeah yeah this is very good that's it yeah everything is good wrought about good the signal everything but after that what I did one District that's it that's exactly it otherwise the uh I dropped well and there is biggest problem you know what happened here you went the wrong way I think we have some trouble following Sat Nav instructions aren't you what what mistake I did here when I come I I said this is a Tar this is not Junction yeah because okay so let me let me talk about yeah you you thought it was a 10 but then on the wrong side we were turning on the wrong side that's when I had to grab the wheel I tried to write yeah so you're supposed to go on the left and then turn but you were turning from the right so I had to grab the wheel back yes yes but let's talk about um I feel like a lot of the issues I want to get you used to following Sat Nav a bit more now because,1007.88,1068.72,931,202,yQ84-NHrgV8,1305,https://youtu.be/yQ84-NHrgV8?t=1007,
you know on the sat nav you can see the blue line right yes yes even if you're not listening to her you can just see the Blue Line make sure you're following that line yeah because back there there was a roundabout yeah um the sat nav was telling you to go straight and you made a right turn with no signal okay and then we went down that icy road we were not meant to go down there you went the wrong way oh good because that level saying go straight that's why I said I bound about go straight yeah and you turned right yeah yeah I took right yeah we were supposed to go straight okay yeah so I want to get you used to following alongside followers not uh but we're not going the wrong way is not a problem but you made a right turn with no signal okay there was a car coming towards us yes yes how do they know you're gonna turn right yes yes sir yeah yeah so going the wrong ways it wasn't the problem so let's talk about the test,1069.86,1120.799,934,200,yQ84-NHrgV8,1305,https://youtu.be/yQ84-NHrgV8?t=1069,
so the first half of the test was really nice you were you were doing really well but instructions with the sat nav is definitely a bit of a concern so I'm going to get you used to like kind of looking and following that a bit more now after this yeah um the roundabout greenford going straight was very nice the maneuver parallel parking you did that really well just keep it a bit more controlled on that downhill bit okay because it was starting to go yeah you did really well with looking around you knew that learner car was waiting so you looked at them they're like what are they doing and then they carried on waiting so you carried on so it was good but there's the biggest problem I got because I don't realize there is a junction and oh yeah I I don't I think what happened is like you said because that one mistake happened yeah I mean more happened yeah oh straight afterwards when you break I said oh my God this is this is something that you,1122.059,1170.6,956,193,yQ84-NHrgV8,1305,https://youtu.be/yQ84-NHrgV8?t=1122,
know in confusion I put race did you realize when at that point at that point I didn't realize you will see hmm I I I press the resume it's because I was pressing the brake and you were pressing the accelerator because you didn't want to stop for her I've stopped first one stop really on the edge the one mistake makes me very but this is something that we need to learn from now so okay yes we definitely should have seen her but even after that mistake happened you've got to drive safely right okay because all the other mistakes happen because your your mind is still stuck yeah yeah on that one thing and then rest is good the first time was really good and then this is first I practice we haven't been here for a while we did this ages ago remember in your first mock test yeah yeah yeah we did it then yeah so it has been a while since we've been to this roundabout yeah it's very good but need more condensation yeah so we're definitely gonna go and work on,1173.419,1234.02,967,201,yQ84-NHrgV8,1305,https://youtu.be/yQ84-NHrgV8?t=1173,
some of these things now um this is good and you know when you're driving because it was like okay sorry there was like a little bit of hesitation on some Junctions like the mini roundabout earlier so we need to make sure we're working on that hesitation as well um on some of these roads because it's icy or it's foggy don't go all the way to 20 sometimes we were driving a bit fast okay so be careful with that oh yeah we're definitely gonna go work on the statlab now yeah sign up with yes and turning also yeah so we're gonna go and work on the sat nav and some of these Junctions now looking at Road markings a bit more clearly is that yes yeah all right well that's the end of our mock test video today um yeah still work to do but we've still got time so it's not concerning so don't worry yeah um major concern is clear now yeah like the clearance was really nice you know,1235.58,1283.64,880,193,yQ84-NHrgV8,1305,https://youtu.be/yQ84-NHrgV8?t=1235,
at no point did I feel like you were going too close to cars before that was a big thing yes so yeah there's definitely Improvement but we've still got a bit more work to do but we've got time so don't worry yeah okay okay don't let this dishearten you okay no no no yeah thank you bye-bye [Music],1285.14,1303.4,297,71,yQ84-NHrgV8,1305,https://youtu.be/yQ84-NHrgV8?t=1285,

okay it's good because I I continuously checking the mirror when you said the car is near I checked the mirror I and I moved to my Lane which one sorry the after that where you grab this that was the same roundabout the same roundabout that was the same third exit yeah no when we went straight I didn't grab the steering when I did when we turned right you said uh the Cyber car is there so that was when you went the first time first time yeah okay the same thing yeah the second uh roundabout I did well the fourth I did well yeah I checked the mirror I followed the layer first then I go the second layer and then I go the third lane and then I put the signal and yeah all I did because what the sat nav says there is the sat nav says at the roundabout go straight ahead and then turn right I said he should stay right and take the second exit when I grab that what the right because there's no chance to move,1137.419,1202.4,913,194,jNoyVHWXQak,1489,https://youtu.be/jNoyVHWXQak?t=1137,

about the rest of the drive okay really nice with the small roads and stuff the greenford roundabout you had a major issue and then when we went on the 40 slip Road there was um that big lorry you dealt with that very nicely because speed up you saw him and you got a little bit scared and then you went nope I'm going and then you sped up yes yes raise the speed that's it yeah you did well with that you were confident which was nice then we went to the next round about fourth exit very nice just make sure you're checking your mirrors a little bit earlier earlier okay but overall position was really nice now we did have one more foe serious emergency stop oh better to stop did you check back later did you look around before you moved off where did you look I did you checked mirrors where are you supposed to look back blind spot sled Squad okay I did this I didn't practice board before but we're in the middle of the road right oh yeah,1293.36,1356.059,945,197,jNoyVHWXQak,1489,https://youtu.be/jNoyVHWXQak?t=1293,
yeah yeah I did a jig so the main issue was you didn't check your blind spots before moving off you just put mirrors and I was like oh no oh good okay okay so we had two serious faults basically okay um first one not about it's not it's just silly it was really silly because you can see you're gonna go straight and I'm like what is she doing it's very easy yeah it's very easy but when you saw that black car you shouldn't have been moving over he was right there and then I had to just yeah because you could see him you would if you had stayed in that right lane the Middle Lane sorry the guy didn't take the other that's why true but you could actually exit from the Middle Lane there as well yeah two ladies yeah I told you I see left of middle say go left say left and uh straight yeah at the Middle Lane also is going straight exactly yeah so you should have stayed there but I will take I totally in position right I see that,1357.44,1416.24,934,201,jNoyVHWXQak,1489,https://youtu.be/jNoyVHWXQak?t=1357,
type in the second exit it says defiled stayed the wrong I will take the third exit exactly yeah going the wrong way you know when the car switched off that was your first mistake that's when you made one main mistake at that point and I thought okay let me see how she handles it because I didn't want to say anything yeah yeah but um yeah it's okay we'll fix that we still have time yeah so I think that's the end of our video for today yes how are you feeling though good good with little silly mistake I did otherwise I'll pass but that mistake I do yeah I feel like about that roundabout yeah everything but so what are you gonna do for now I I put the flavor let me guess okay so what are you gonna do next time when you realize you're in the wrong lane I will take the same exit on the third exit whichever exit yes but if you see someone's next to you can we switch lanes no no no definitely not okay,1419.419,1467.78,908,195,jNoyVHWXQak,1489,https://youtu.be/jNoyVHWXQak?t=1419,

hi guys welcome back to Clearview driving my name is Ammon and today I have another driving lesson lesson oh let me go again we have another mock test with her mom sorry yes lost my track there first thing in the morning okay so we've done some driving lessons and now your test is coming up in just two weeks time yes and hopefully I passed how are you feeling I'm feeling good you know yeah really good yeah he knows what he's doing so today we're looking for a nice pass um so yeah mock test standard you know what's expected from you throughout the drive follow the road ahead whenever I need you to turn I will tell you if not keep going straight okay if you're not sure where you're going you can simply ask okay we'll maneuver maybe the emergency stop I've done that yet okay before we get started I'm going to ask you a quick question could you tell me how sorry where would you identify the engine coolant and how do you check if,23.96,75.659,938,194,tf2gp7ni69k,1700,https://youtu.be/tf2gp7ni69k?t=23,
it's at the right level to engine coolant uh you'd find that in the Bonnet and that's why you fill it up and you'd normally get a warning if it's below a level okay that sounds fine so for anyone that's new to the channel and don't forget to like the video comment down below what you think of Vermont's progress actually and select that Bell icon so that you get a notification every time that I upload now we're going to go straight into it we're gonna do this without the sat nav today so I'll give you some independent driving on the go but yeah whenever you're ready let's get started okay good luck is that oh what do you want it on now sure I was just asking for something I'll turn on Okay hi you good to go yeah just making sure [Music] we're good to go right that way around the Trolley system that way it doesn't matter uh yeah you're right it's not fair right now all right so right at the roundabout,77.28,151.2,912,202,tf2gp7ni69k,1700,https://youtu.be/tf2gp7ni69k?t=77,
okay I'll give you a few seconds to get into it okay all right we're in hi guys welcome back to another mock test as you guys already know these videos are designed to help you improve your driving skills or if you've got a test coming up little tips and tricks to avoid getting caught out now as we're going forward Raman does get a minor mistake on Junction observation the roundabout we're moving on to has three lanes the first Lane was clear but there was a car in the second lane who could have switched over Lanes so it would have been safer to wait instead of taking this Gap as the van in the roundabout could be trying to switch into the left hand lane foreign the vehicle in the roundabout is going to be staying in that lane it's not safe to make this assumption so we should have waited until the van had gone round a little more and then entered the roundabout after in this example the van happened to stay in the overtaking lane,152.7,219.84,944,195,tf2gp7ni69k,1700,https://youtu.be/tf2gp7ni69k?t=152,
but had they been switching over it would have gone down as a serious fault [Music] okay Roman we're going to start the independent driving from here okay so we get to the next roundabout I'd like you to turn right it's the third exit then we're going to follow signs to Hayes town so third exit okay and then he's tell yep [Music],221.58,254.67,331,75,tf2gp7ni69k,1700,https://youtu.be/tf2gp7ni69k?t=221,

foreign as we entered this roundabout Rahman does make a serious mistake with use of mirrors change direction he goes into the overtaking lane and then switches back into the left without checking his mirrors as we enter the roundabout he needed to follow the white line to the left of him which would have taken him into the perfect position to turn right [Music],306.12,330.19,364,70,tf2gp7ni69k,1700,https://youtu.be/tf2gp7ni69k?t=306,
had Rahman checked his mirrors and indicated to switch back into this Lane this would have been okay as the vehicle behind was slightly further but as he didn't check his mirrors it's a straight serious fault [Music] okay [Music],351.72,377.69,229,46,tf2gp7ni69k,1700,https://youtu.be/tf2gp7ni69k?t=351,

Ramon does really well with the clearance from the left as soon as you get a line of part Vehicles be sure to check your mirrors and move out early at least two car lengths before the park vehicle the closer you get to the vehicle the slower you should be traveling [Music] ahead of us is a 20 miles per hour Zone as soon as Roman sees this he switches back into second gear this is a good way of controlling the speed of your vehicle so that you don't go too fast using a higher gear is good for fuel efficiency but when you want more control it's better to use a lower gear at the roundabout to turn left here is a prime example of why you should always check your mirrors before indicating the motorbike behind us is starting to come up on the left [Music] although motorbikes shouldn't pass on the left like this as there's not enough space and it's a single Lane but it does happen [Music],602.16,673.22,894,191,tf2gp7ni69k,1700,https://youtu.be/tf2gp7ni69k?t=602,
what is that I don't know it looks like a tricycle motorcycle moped combo with a learner driver with a reckless other driver on it I thought that guy was gonna try and undercut me yeah he looked like it you tried yeah because he overtook me right there okay Ramon when it's safe to do so I'd like you to demonstrate how you would use the ball thank you [Laughter] I missed my challenge take the next Road on your right please [Music],681.779,718.95,433,96,tf2gp7ni69k,1700,https://youtu.be/tf2gp7ni69k?t=681,
thank you [Music] on the left just behind the white card don't worry about the driveways on this occasion [Music] that's fine though thank you okay Ramon what we're gonna do now is I'd like you to use the vehicle ahead to carry out the parallel park exercise let's start alongside the vehicle in the road then reverse back and finish within two car lots just make sure you don't go up on the pavement at all okay [Music],750.42,789.64,420,93,tf2gp7ni69k,1700,https://youtu.be/tf2gp7ni69k?t=750,
foreign [Music] does carry out the parallel park exercise really nicely but he does have a habit of steering with one hand now this isn't necessarily A Fault In the driving test but it's good practice to always steer with both hands so you have better control while stirring with one hand if you lose control of the steering wheel then that will be an issue thank you whilst carrying out the parallel park exercise Raman does briefly go forward but this doesn't get counted as a minor fault as he was already in the space if you need to go forward to adjust the maneuver because you weren't in the space then that will be counted as a minor fault tribe up Olivia ready [Music] foreign [Music],806.94,870.73,692,139,tf2gp7ni69k,1700,https://youtu.be/tf2gp7ni69k?t=806,

coming up to this van ahead Ramon gets a serious Vault for clearance as we get too close remain pretty much draws a straight line between these two points getting too close to the van now he did steer but he didn't steer enough so he needed to wiggle through the space and go slowly as it is a tight Gap foreign [Music] does stop but he gets too close to the point where the vehicle couldn't actually come out and then we had to go through a really tight Gap it's a good idea to stop at least two columns away whenever anyone is doing a maneuver me okay he splashed me [Music] if you can pull in and park up on the left hand side don't worry about the drives again just in that space there is mine [Music] thank you okay Roman so shortly I'm gonna get you to carry out the emergency stop okay as you're driving down this road I'm going to make sure it's nice,992.22,1078.44,858,188,tf2gp7ni69k,1700,https://youtu.be/tf2gp7ni69k?t=992,
and safe and I'm going to give you a signal stop as soon as you get that signal I need you to react by stopping the car as quickly and as safely as possible okay okay I will make sure it's safe before I give you that signal all right so whenever you're ready [Music] stop thank you I'm not gonna get you to do that again drive up when you're ready [Music] would the emergency stop remind does stop very quickly but he puts the clutch down first and stamps on the brake now this causes the ABS to go off now the ABS going off is not a fault but when trying to stop always break firm and then clutch as well [Music] I'm gonna have to reverse this one dominate the trash with this meeting situation the vehicle head was actually about to go into the space on the right and Roman goes in first never give way on the right hand side of the road like this we should have stopped in the middle and the vehicle in front should have gone into the space on the right,1079.52,1195.44,956,204,tf2gp7ni69k,1700,https://youtu.be/tf2gp7ni69k?t=1079,

I I can't lie I think I failed why is that I don't know I just have a gut feeling that failed and you'll love things I'm guessing I did I'm just laughing because I don't know why I just have a gut feeling that I failed I did something so stupid I'm thinking and you're smiling so I did okay you did make some silly I did sorry yeah died off well it started off really well and then there was one which was that serious yes there was one serious fault at first and I thought oh I can't believe he's just done that but it was one of those ones where it is something that you need to be aware about but then I thought okay it's just that one mistake and we had no other mistakes and then as we went on we had like two serious mistakes one after the other what was it so the first mistake because you know that big roundabout where I said turn right third exit and then,1327.799,1381.08,865,190,tf2gp7ni69k,1700,https://youtu.be/tf2gp7ni69k?t=1327,
follow signs into this town because I went off on the lane I got confusing money a bit yeah you well you went into the overtaking lane so you know as you entered that roundabout there were two lanes that said hey which one did you go into the one on the right yeah but then as you went round the roundabout you were on the left weren't you oh yeah I didn't indicate you didn't even check your mirror there was a car behind us like a Ford Focus I think so you've just kind of your attention was on the right and you've slid across behind that large vehicle I'm trying to figure out which lane was the yeah but had you checked that left mirror would have been fine because the car's distance was okay like but the fact that you didn't check your mirror was a safety issue because he could have been speeding up okay and then the fact that you're still signaling right he doesn't even know you're trying to move left okay so mirror signal was the must at that point,1382.58,1431.419,962,202,tf2gp7ni69k,1700,https://youtu.be/tf2gp7ni69k?t=1382,
all right yeah yep the other one was a silly one you know when um the parallel parking was really nice okay then as we're driving through you know when we did that roundabout turn third exit and then we're kind of behind there was a van parked up right next to the roundabout as we come out the roundabout there was a van parked near the island oh yeah it was like close it was quite close that was a series yes it would be close clearance yeah but we I noticed it was close so I slowed down a bit yeah but then but we're still going through that space quite fast considering how tight that space was I wasn't I was just trying to keep the whatever but no that's what I mean all right considering how tight that space was yeah your speed was now too fast okay it was on 20 wasn't it it was a 20 Road then as we were going through you know that black Mercedes stand up what happened with her she just let me,1433.28,1483.32,906,196,tf2gp7ni69k,1700,https://youtu.be/tf2gp7ni69k?t=1433,
go forward okay why did you go into the space on the right where the bins were oh because she wasn't stopping so I had to she was actually trying to go into that space so what happened with that car was you're going towards her the space is clearly on the right and she's she's trying to get into it but you've just kind of knows First dove in okay she's not she was not expecting that at all okay we never because I saw her Wheels twitch like a bit she was trying to get into it so judgmental meeting because we shouldn't go on that side at all what should we have done instead wait for her to go yeah you just needed to stop in the middle let her get out the way and then continue before she went and she flashed me I saw that and I was like oh this this you want me to go in there so then I don't remember the flash but it might have been flash that hasn't come through I'll go,1485.48,1532.34,880,194,tf2gp7ni69k,1700,https://youtu.be/tf2gp7ni69k?t=1485,
out of your way all right because so that speeding thing like going through that thing was that really a serious I'll show you because the thing is it felt close like if if it's because I'm not gonna still hold up on that one yeah it's one of those ones where if it's close just slow it down oh slow all right I guess yeah it is what it is all right like the thing is I don't want you to go forward taking these driving on your own on your tests yep if you know it's a tight space just take your time with it all right and you remember Mrs Singh with his silver Mercedes reversing on a driveway yeah what's he doing he's racing into the driveway was he trying to come out or what I think he was going in okay he was actually trying to come out the drive okay I waited and then he flashed me to go forward but let's think about where you waited another word hey come out he's doing some sort of maneuver right,1534.5,1592.159,908,197,tf2gp7ni69k,1700,https://youtu.be/tf2gp7ni69k?t=1534,
yes I slowed down we should have stopped further back because then at least it you that way if he wants to come out you've kind of just gone up there like this yeah and then he's now not able to come forward so he had to wait for you okay and so you see you you kind of you know the the size of your vehicle really well but then you're quite happy squeezing through tight spaces you don't want to be doing that he doesn't like being told off you see he's just like I'm going to talk about this after I'm going to talk about this after he's gonna have it I knew I messed up the start as soon as I went on that roundabout because I was because I knew I was confused about where Haze is yeah so yeah I had a question yeah go ahead so do you think I'll be able to pause when I take my driving test oh yeah of course you will we get the thing is right it's better that these mistakes,1593.48,1638.9,878,197,tf2gp7ni69k,1700,https://youtu.be/tf2gp7ni69k?t=1593,
are happening now because then you can learn from them still I know it's not the result you wanted today I don't know I was expecting a past for like just about yeah but I think this is a fail because mostly the series I am taking you on challenging routes I'm not going to take you on easy Road and be like all right why is that why should I take your knees your roots because then you'd be like you know what this test is a breeze and you're gonna go into is that gonna be the thing you think we're on hard roots on purpose it's it's better that way isn't it I guess yeah yeah okay well that is the end of our video today guys hopefully that video has been useful so don't forget to give it a thumbs up comment down below what you think of romance progress from his first mock test I'll be sure to link that at the beginning so you can see the difference I've got medicine on the road anymore,1640.64,1684.38,894,193,tf2gp7ni69k,1700,https://youtu.be/tf2gp7ni69k?t=1640,

yes you shouldn't go into that gear on a roundabout I've done it but if you lose control of the steering or do something funny because you're looking at me then yes that will be a fault eyes on the road now as we're going forward Jesse does get a serious fault for use of speed now the space ahead is fairly narrow and there are part vehicles on the left-hand side and we've just been driving on a 50 miles per hour road for some time now she's driving fairly fast but doesn't realize as we're going forward a vehicle comes around the corner and they're forced to a stop because we're continuing so fast mirrors I'm telling you I'll check them away hello hello come on you've got plenty of are you shaking your head at me for [Music] hello hello hello come on you've got plenty years were you shaking your head at me for [Music] did you see the amount of space he had between him and the curb,702.54,760.56,892,194,7NDKc1N96W4,2016,https://youtu.be/7NDKc1N96W4?t=702,
can I let him off he looks like he had more years of experience so just make sure guys whenever you've got parked vehicles in your path and you're crossing over into the opposite side of the road you do not have priority and you want to approach with caution because he's pulled up in a bus stop [Laughter] [Music] boy that's a bit dangerous you know there's cars behind me I need to let them know what I'm doing so like there's no speed signs okay so what would it be I wouldn't actually say 30 but now you're going to tell me because there's houses on one side and it's a residential area there should be 20.

and try not to touch the curb as you're doing this I don't know why I stopped I'm assuming I need to look over some reason I'm just gonna do it anyway can you tell me what two comments are please that's one how small is this car my car oh you know what let's just go further back a little bit more yeah I think that's about too close okay drive up whenever you're ready I'm pulling in park up on the left just behind this silver car I think it's fine yeah brilliant to turn it off really have a little breather that's the end of your test how's your drive it's good I enjoyed it okay you're getting nervous no okay good all right so that's the end of your test okay so realistically if this was your driving test you would not have Buckley yeah yeah why there's two reasons did I get any Services yes no okay wait so you remember that meeting situation where the guy was shaking his head,1655.58,1738.86,887,193,7NDKc1N96W4,2016,https://youtu.be/7NDKc1N96W4?t=1655,
yeah yeah what happened there he's in my way so we're driving through so you're saying I should have stopped we should have at least slowed down like we it was a it was a 30 Road there's parked cars on the left and you're moving you're right listen you can drive yes but that little bit there we're whizzing through he's turned up you've breaked a little and he's shaking his head and you're just kind of and you're like what's he doing I'm just like I think I'll handle the situation really well yeah I know no I know I can't understand but do you get why it would have been because it's it's not your priority right yeah because I'm in his Lane yeah that's why he was shaking his head okay fair enough yeah okay that was a city one but it's just like we've just come off of driving at 50. hmm and so you didn't realize but you were actually,1740.659,1794.6,842,195,7NDKc1N96W4,2016,https://youtu.be/7NDKc1N96W4?t=1740,
still a bit fast that's why you thought you were okay but we just kind of I know you dealt with the space and stuff but no okay priority wise that that's that's where the issue comes in and then the next one was to do with your reversing on the right just now was that serious there was a series with your observation part so you're reversing right yeah um you looked around everywhere but when you're reversing you you've not checked your left blind spot and there was a car passing you on the left and you just happily carried on reversing so in a driving test if you're parked up on the right and somebody passes you close you shouldn't keep reversing obviously you were quite slow and controlled and stuff but just you don't want to be moving while somebody's passing you oh I don't know that one so like if a learner does that in a test yeah yeah I really didn't know that one now there were loads of good parts as well of your drive like your roundabouts,1795.919,1848.659,960,198,7NDKc1N96W4,2016,https://youtu.be/7NDKc1N96W4?t=1795,
you're taking them really nicely nice and confident and you're even using your mirrors kind of moving back into the lane and all that it's all really good stuff I don't know why I'm actually really upset about this okay yeah but you know what it is it's because you know what you're doing but you sometimes take these things a bit faster and you know the space and size of your vehicle you dealt with the ambulance really nice you know when we're kind of just in that lane so you can see they were trying to go through that space so you moving forward yes we want to keep the space in front but you can see moving forward it's going to help that scenario that was really good um just something to be mindful with again Learners wouldn't do this you know when you're at Junctions and you're looking for a gap whether it be in a roundabout or a t-junction you you can see that you're going to go after a gray car,1851.6,1892.34,910,195,7NDKc1N96W4,2016,https://youtu.be/7NDKc1N96W4?t=1851,
let's say as that gray car is getting there what you do is you start preparing your feet and you're rolling before that gray car's even gone is that what I did yeah like twice I think so just be careful with that just kind of I know they're going but what if they kind of do something yeah what if they stop yeah yeah yeah yeah so you want to just give it a bit like another second between you just let them go yeah but yeah okay trying to think if there's any other points to mention can you mention some good points now I did I did I said you always you checking your mirrors you're signaling at the right points you're driving at the right speed you always trying to move back into the left lane you sometimes follow cars too closely because they're not at the speed of the road yeah the bus lane you don't want to use it this prime example why I don't use Muslims you saw it you're like oh my God,1893.779,1939.14,900,192,7NDKc1N96W4,2016,https://youtu.be/7NDKc1N96W4?t=1893,
would you have said anything had I gone into it I would have told you you just you gotta get out of this no okay that's the right thing but I was waiting for you to see and you saw the signs but you panicked when you saw the signs this is why I don't use mostly I didn't say use the bustling I just asked a question yeah and you just you just went straight in yeah yeah but that that's where the buffling um becomes buses only it's okay I can come back in a couple of months you're really alert though like you know with my man over here and your man over there and you know what's also what's that word perception so what if he decided all of a second he wants to run into the road so there we go so it was all really good with like the awareness of what's happening on the road okay yeah all right guys that is the end of today's mock test hopefully that's been useful as you can see an experienced,1943.299,1990.679,900,197,7NDKc1N96W4,2016,https://youtu.be/7NDKc1N96W4?t=1943,

the recommended tire pressure and how do you check this okay or next to the door there should be some some of the information about the tire okay tire pressure and all you can then use it too how do you check it then with the pressure gauge I think that's fine okay so for anyone that's new to the channel don't forget to like the video comment down below what you think if there's any questions let me know and don't forget to subscribe and select that Bell icon so that you get a notification every time that I upload so I'm ready whenever you're ready yep so throughout the drive follow the road ahead whenever I need to turn I will tell you okay okay you can start the engine and we'll move off from here,117.06,166.98,708,147,zuSzGTFMLBA,2122,https://youtu.be/zuSzGTFMLBA?t=117,

huh is it that's the end of your test how's your drive I didn't expect that it is only oh sorry sorry time I didn't expect because it's smooth and I was enjoying the drive I just felt like so comfortable yeah firstly and maybe because of your car so smooth first gear I was expecting little more access I mean if we go a little far but then uh we have to come back to gate to I mean very quickly yeah very quickly okay how was your drive overall would you say there are any bits that you're concerned about maybe two places I would say okay uh one thing is like um there are two bikes the Cycles going on the road and it's a corner Bend yeah maybe I should have waited back forth instead of for taking that corner maybe I failed there that's one point okay other point is like uh I have seen uh one of the speed change on the right hand side 46 40 symbol I thought it's a single one so I,1533.14,1597.2,887,195,zuSzGTFMLBA,2122,https://youtu.be/zuSzGTFMLBA?t=1533,
thought it's a 40 Road and as I just need to go for the I mean below 40. so I just accelerated and when I could see it just bit far away it was a change of speed from there from that point which means I should have been under 30 till that point um that bit wasn't bad actually no slime okay but the cyclist unfortunately you would have failed at that point okay like you said so yourself there's two cyclists riding side by side there's a Bend yeah what was going through your head at that point want to do it or not and then I just went off it was already sixth point to try and overtake because at any point I was just thinking somebody can come on the corner yeah you're putting yourself in danger and them because now if someone comes you're gonna yeah we have to go to the exactly and we kind of seconds so that was a really bad spot to overtake besides that okay you do know how to drive you drive,1600.02,1659.84,903,195,zuSzGTFMLBA,2122,https://youtu.be/zuSzGTFMLBA?t=1600,
really well there's lots of really good things but you do need to sort out your approach speed approach speed yeah you sometimes get to roundabouts a bit too fast okay you know you did okay be under 20. it depends on the roundabout like if the roundabout's Fairly open the lanes are quite wide and you're kind of smoothly kind of going around yeah but if the roundabout's quite tight and now you're having to wiggle through you're still keeping it in fourth gear and the car just feels like [Music] you know where where earlier we had the double roundabout yeah yeah that nearly gave you a fault there because nearly gave you a serious thought really because you're going through that the first round about position was great okay but you kept it in fourth gear and it felt fast on the second round about we had that light blue car coming okay and I know we had the distance but what if we were now yeah and that right hand,1662.12,1708.559,923,192,zuSzGTFMLBA,2122,https://youtu.be/zuSzGTFMLBA?t=1662,
side yeah yeah yeah I did realize that yeah so definitely when you've got a junction a roundabout or you know you're going to be required to turn more definitely drop it down to three if not two depending on the size of the roundabout okay yeah yeah you can do it in fourth but not those roundabouts I wouldn't be ground Awards maybe yeah if it's like nobody's there you can just if you're not really required to turn then yes but if you're having to kind of Wiggle around you're asking for trouble with that one yeah yeah um yeah lots of really good things you were doing you were speeding up slowing down all of that was really nice it was just the approach speed that was bugging me a little bit okay cyclist in general cyclist in general played up three times yeah so first we had the uh I think it's the ubereats yeah it was on the High Street I took uh I went to you kept going close to him and you couldn't,1710.419,1757.34,913,197,zuSzGTFMLBA,2122,https://youtu.be/zuSzGTFMLBA?t=1710,
overtake him yeah but you were a bit too close to him okay but then he kind of went okay yeah like don't if you know you can't overtake a cyclist just be fired up just be further back okay because around London you get them all the time don't you yeah yeah yeah yeah and then we had the other Evo yeah there you go there were three occasions with cyclists one was the ubereats yes when you're getting a bit close yeah the second was the two cyclists where you now got your serious fault the kid in the yeah yeah and then the third one was slightly further down on the same road and this time we could see the road ahead and there was like a Tesco van in front that's cool then yeah yeah and even when you overtook there there was like a black jaguar coming towards us and I was just like oh I'm not liking because you have to think Jaguar okay I might not be a black jaguar but I can't,1758.419,1804.2,885,196,zuSzGTFMLBA,2122,https://youtu.be/zuSzGTFMLBA?t=1758,
remember it was a Jag it was a Jag for sure but it was the third cyclist okay where you could see the road ahead this time and you're trying to go around him but there's also a car coming towards you at the same time it just felt like it was a bit close between us going and in the car arriving okay because now we're going into their side aren't we couldn't reconnect that yeah it's on the same bit with the two cyclists together okay it's just shortly after on the same road okay yeah were there any other do you see this fights which means no no the serious fault is just the two cyclists the corner that's it and the other one the other one it wasn't no no it was just basically in terms of a driving test the reason why you would have failed today would be the cyclists that you were trying to overtake them on that you overtook them on the bend yep that's it okay besides that you'll approach speed needs looking at because you kind of uh,1805.52,1856.46,944,202,zuSzGTFMLBA,2122,https://youtu.be/zuSzGTFMLBA?t=1805,
getting to those roundabouts a bit too quickly okay okay yeah let me reduce it down to maybe third and second gear yeah depending on the size of the route and then uh did you think we were a bit fast when we took those in fourth gear yeah yeah it was fast sometimes uh maybe because of the way I the change of Gears right I might not have adjusted so quickly yeah but I was a bit fast in one or two roundabouts that I felt maybe I could reduce the speed yeah but I was your car has made me overjoy yes and then I have to fish yeah so definitely just a little slower for the roundabout yep yep but yeah your major concern would have just been the tooth like this um so yeah just be a little bit more careful with cyclists because they are more vulnerable aren't they yeah and we don't want to be putting them in danger generally when it comes to cyclists there are three points where you shouldn't overtake do you know,1859.159,1910.7,917,194,zuSzGTFMLBA,2122,https://youtu.be/zuSzGTFMLBA?t=1859,
where they are Corners yeah so Benz yeah bands and when you can't see the I mean oh okay you know again when you can't see yeah you can't see definitely yeah and then the last one would be um I'll be uh Junctions Junctions okay so when we're going forward and then there's a junction on the left here on the right we don't want to move on the wrong side in case someone oh okay okay yeah so three points would be on when there's a Bend because you can't see the road ahead when there's a brow Hill when you can't see the road ahead and when there are Junctions about because again the road is unpredictable right so any place if someone breaks because of you is it a serious one yeah so anything that you're doing if it's affecting other drivers and they're having to take action because of it then yes um so for example roundabouts you want to be giving priority to traffic on your right so if they're now approaching from,1912.08,1964.22,923,199,zuSzGTFMLBA,2122,https://youtu.be/zuSzGTFMLBA?t=1912,
your right and now having to break for you then yeah okay okay so how was your mock test experience today are you wonderful happy experience and uh I didn't even know that it's one hour already and then I have to stop because I was thinking why you made me stop we could have gone somewhere now overall you've got a really nice drive you just need to tighten it up a little bit in like these few places that we talked about okay one is the approach speed approach speed detection take care of the bicycles whenever you look around there and uh yeah I mean up mainly the speed speed and then roundabouts that's it just making sure that you're being a bit more cautious on the lead-up to roundabouts the positioning on the roundabouts was great um the mirror checks and everything was really nice it's just the kind of the approach to it don't get there too quickly I know you're confident with third and fourth that doesn't mean you should be doing a roundabout in fourth,1966.38,2019.059,970,196,zuSzGTFMLBA,2122,https://youtu.be/zuSzGTFMLBA?t=1966,
year great okay yeah yeah um emergency stop really nice Quick Stop um good observation all around really nice the reverse around the you know the Bay Park to the right the control was fine um the observation was a little bit lacking on that right blind spot right blunt what okay because you kept checking the mirror looking to the left track in the mirror looking to the left there was nobody to the right and that mirror does cover the right side yeah but not the blind spot and if somebody had turned up there was a lady later on but she was a bit further away so it was okay but you still need to just check that side a bit more okay is it okay to always need to look at the blind spot or we can use the mirror switch too because with the mirror you can't actually see the blinds but if you were leaning forward into the mirror like this that would have been different because that shows more but just because you're so slow already just kind of turn yeah okay yeah like that yeah so what,2020.44,2071.139,992,197,zuSzGTFMLBA,2122,https://youtu.be/zuSzGTFMLBA?t=2020,

hi guys welcome back to Clearview driving my name is Amin and today I'm doing a mock test with monster now this is the first time we're driving together and you've only had about two three hours of driving lessons with an instructor yeah but he has had a lot of practice driving in general with family so that's great that's where you've had majority of your training really yeah and that was in what three months you said yeah okay and you don't have a driving test book at the moment no I don't okay so you wanted to do this mock test to kind of gauge where you are yeah I see my level yeah I'll sit and then go forward he's really shy okay so you know what to expect from this mock test today what's how it's gonna go okay so throughout the drive I want you to follow the road ahead whenever I need you to turn I will tell you if I don't say anything keep going,45.66,95.939,864,188,k4bSdTzHBys,2025,https://youtu.be/k4bSdTzHBys?t=45,

clearly he didn't see you soon [Music] how silly [Music] in the distance ahead there is a width restriction and the key when dealing with the width restriction is to position early as if you're parking slow down and select a lower gear and Mansura does this very well [Music],582.12,617.2,275,60,k4bSdTzHBys,2025,https://youtu.be/k4bSdTzHBys?t=582,
if you could pull in and park up on the left hand side just on the yellow line here will be fine we can just go a little bit further that'll be great that's great though thank you okay monster I'm going to get you to start the independent driving from here okay so when we go down this road I'd like you to follow some signs towards Harrow okay yeah okay if you forget you can't ask so I'm gonna be ready whatever you're asked to park up the car always make sure to secure the vehicle and switch your indicator off in this case when sir has forgotten to switch off his left indicator and he's now waiting to move off with his left indicator still on which can be very confusing for traffic on the main road [Music],645.54,721.82,714,152,k4bSdTzHBys,2025,https://youtu.be/k4bSdTzHBys?t=645,

now the traffic lights are likely to turn right please right yes yes when trying to switch lanes Mentor always slows down waiting for the traffic on the right to give him way rather than trying to match the speed of the road if you're matching the speed of the road it's a lot easier for traffic on the right to give way to you,1096.38,1114.679,327,67,k4bSdTzHBys,2025,https://youtu.be/k4bSdTzHBys?t=1096,

front we're going to carry out the parallel park exercise so starting the road alongside the vehicle then reverse back and finish within two carlands which you've got here okay and try not to go on the paper unless you do this I'd suggest you reverse back before you come out of this position okay yeah okay [Music],1256.36,1279.56,315,64,k4bSdTzHBys,2025,https://youtu.be/k4bSdTzHBys?t=1256,
when it comes to any of the Maneuvers there are two things that you're being observed on one is your control whether or not you can do the maneuver and second is your observation if you're aware of your surroundings whilst you're reversing before starting to reverse monsura looks all around checking over both blind spots but when he has to change direction he forgets to look around now this gets marked down as a serious fault as he does not check his right blind spot before starting to reverse again [Music] thank you,1299.0,1346.52,522,104,k4bSdTzHBys,2025,https://youtu.be/k4bSdTzHBys?t=1299,

when it comes to turning left all turning right Mansour does check his mirrors before moving into that direction but when he's just traveling along in a straight line he does not check his mirrors regularly enough the vehicle behind us was looking for an opportunity to overtake but Mentor doesn't realize this he only notices them when they've done overtaking you always want to be aware of your surroundings [Music] what a silly place to overtake [Music] so what was wrong with where they overtook because this is a question and they were on they were overtaken when you want to bend weren't they so anybody could have turned up in front if you could pull over and park up on the lift anywhere safe please [Music] thank you secure the car and you can switch off the engine that's the end of your driving test how's your drive no I'll sell some big Falls in there [Music] wasn't enough for you at all but we take it,1500.96,1607.64,916,191,k4bSdTzHBys,2025,https://youtu.be/k4bSdTzHBys?t=1500,
you actually drive really nicely very smooth it's it's a really nice drive there are lots of really good things happening but if this was a driving test um you would have failed just because there's a few not not for a massive reason but it's just I feel like you could be a bit more confident with a bit more practice that's what you want to do yeah so firstly the main issue for me was that gear was all right but we stalled twice quite badly in second year and then you eventually realize yeah yeah um I want you to be a bit more confident when you're um trying to switch lanes you know when you went into that bus lane yeah and then I said we're gonna turn right yeah yeah you're kind of driving in that lane and you're checking the traffic next to you and you can see they're coming through but they're driving at the speed of the road now what was the speed on that road yeah yeah so if we're driving,1610.4,1669.159,906,192,k4bSdTzHBys,2025,https://youtu.be/k4bSdTzHBys?t=1610,
lower than 20 is anyone going to slow down to let you in no so if you were kind of matching this video yeah then maybe I could have slipped them yeah yeah definitely so try and adjust your speed kind of to what they're doing be more at the speed of the road I don't want to speed up too much where I'm going and I can't find a space no I get that so it was just I just felt like you were being a little bit cautious so you want to get a bit more practice trying to drive at the same speed and then adjust your speed and move over rather than having to slow right down letting them all through and then eventually move it over like I said there were lots of really good things like I felt like the mini roundabouts where that guy didn't even see you signaling you saw he he wasn't gonna wait and you dealt with him really nicely by slowing down letting him through then turning but another thing you want to be a bit more careful with at Junctions when,1672.86,1720.32,951,202,k4bSdTzHBys,2025,https://youtu.be/k4bSdTzHBys?t=1672,
you're moving through traffic lights and even the other roads where we've got Main Road priority just be a bit more aware of people on the sides rather than just kind of driving in your lane and going yep I have priority a bit more visual of your surroundings like in terms of your mirror checks if I said to you turn left turn right you check your mirrors yeah but if you're just driving in a straight line yeah and you remember that lady that overtook us on that bend yeah did you know she was about to overtake I have no clue no I saw her about to kind of do it earlier about five seconds or 10 seconds even before she actually went and moved across you could see she was leaning to the right you can see she's looking for a gap yeah so you should have already been a bit more proactive yeah aware of that yeah so just a bit more awareness of your surroundings but overall your drive is really nice um yeah there are a few occasions when,1722.12,1775.58,940,194,k4bSdTzHBys,2025,https://youtu.be/k4bSdTzHBys?t=1722,
you're just driving a little slow like um right near the beginning there was that 30 road yeah you were driving 20 you know by HMV yeah yeah and in my other car I'm getting told I drive a bit too fast and then when we were on the um you know when we joined the slip Road yeah I I was still in second year when I was doing this but that was okay but just you when you initially first went in you saw that red car I think it was and you you thought to First slow down and then you thought no no I have to speed up and you did you did well but again you want to be a bit more confident with the length of that slip Pro you can't be messing around yeah you have to get in yeah so we've been more confident in those kind of parts so yes there's driving too fast yeah but there are points where you need to be up to the speed a bit more okay so I thought you want to take forward from this,1777.08,1827.6,883,199,k4bSdTzHBys,2025,https://youtu.be/k4bSdTzHBys?t=1777,
roundabout's really nicely done Willow Tree great observation great positioning everything um yeah I went down to the 20 Zone you respected that as well just regards to that bus lane you know when we come up to that round where we stalled yeah so you could see that bustling was there right yeah okay how long was that bus lane not very long no I wasn't long so there's a bus lane you've gone into it and then right at the very top you can see the road is kind of converging yeah you've kind of left it to the very last bit to just move over you can see the arrow was pushing you in the island sticking out the white cast coming up you're checking but you're not kind of informing them yeah because you can see the island sticking out in your lane yeah they're not paying attention so I would have just moved over earlier yeah definitely for sure so just being a bit more proactive rather than reactive to things but yeah overall it was a good,1828.559,1876.679,943,194,k4bSdTzHBys,2025,https://youtu.be/k4bSdTzHBys?t=1828,
drive just just a shame about some of these little things but you're considering you haven't had a lot of experience with an instructor you've only just done most your driving in the last three months with your dad yeah that was a really nice drive yeah don't be hard on yourself uh let's not talk about a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] world I was gonna get to that next that reverse no no no you know what you're too hard on yourself with that one yeah you did that Park really nicely you need to be a bit more confident and yes I can do it yeah okay you decided to go forward that's where it went a bit funky I thought I was gonna hit the yeah but did you hit it no I didn't hear anything when you got the back tire really close you stopped and you went forward yeah but when you go forward you can't just go forward and that's it you've got to check,1878.659,1925.1,863,196,k4bSdTzHBys,2025,https://youtu.be/k4bSdTzHBys?t=1878,
so every time you're changing direction just a quick look around okay because it's your observation that was kind of really triggering me on that one yeah oh but he's not looking around yeah I'm observation is so cool so just a bit more awareness we surrounding imagine you're on a High Street imagine you're on haste Town High Street yeah and you're reversing and doing that okay so if you know the pavement is there yeah go very very very very slowly let it touch or stop it just before it touches what you don't want to do is come in at speed and then whack yeah or kind of Mount it in one go okay and if you feel like it's starting to raise there might be like a drum a drive it's raising just go forward don't go back but you'll see it on there if you're leaning across like that yeah so we understand the main concerns were just kind of a bit more practice just a little bit more brushing up here and there honestly it's not a bad result yeah yeah,1926.12,1979.46,953,202,k4bSdTzHBys,2025,https://youtu.be/k4bSdTzHBys?t=1926,
um but yeah observation with your reversing would have been another one because it's just you weren't looking around as much the control side was actually good okay like you've got the back tire close and you went forward just look around every time you change directions okay okay all right guys that is the end of our mock test today hopefully that video has been useful for you guys as well how would you say that this helped you would you say this helped you definitely yeah it helped me I just need to it made me look at where like I need I need help on basically yeah and just kind of brush up on but yeah it's definitely helpful 100 yeah really well done all right guys that's the end of the book test,1981.559,2020.38,708,143,k4bSdTzHBys,2025,https://youtu.be/k4bSdTzHBys?t=1981,
