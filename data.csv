[Music] hi guys and welcome to my youtube channel so today we're doing a video on crossroads small and big crossroads this is ted uh we've been driving for about i think about two weeks three weeks nearly yeah yeah probably done about eight eight hours or so think so yeah yeah so um last lesson we worked on big crossroads on dual carriageways turning near side and offside today's lesson we're gonna go over some small crossroads first and then work onto big crossroads just looking at the difference between nearside and offside now do you remember when you would use a near side turn and when you would use an offside then this had to be like a smaller junction and you turned before the traffic yeah and offside probably a bigger one you turn behind the behind the cars behind the traffic yeah so with nearside you you're able to angle yourself sort of 45 and then wait in the middle yeah whereas offside you wait in a straight position,0.0,67.04,941,196,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=0,2 - The driving situation is not critical as it seems like a routine driving lesson with an experienced driver teaching a new driver.,"[Music] Hi guys, and welcome to my YouTube channel. So today, we're doing a video on crossroads, small and big crossroads. This is Ted. We've been driving for about, I think, two or three weeks, nearly. Yeah, yeah, probably done about eight hours or so. Think so, yeah, yeah. So, um, last lesson, we worked on big crossroads on dual carriageways turning near side and offside. Today's lesson, we're gonna go over some small crossroads first and then work onto big crossroads, just looking at the difference between nearside and offside. Now, do you remember when you would use a nearside turn and when you would use an offside? Then, this had to be like a smaller junction and you turn before the traffic. Yeah, and offside, probably a bigger one, you turn behind the cars, behind the traffic. Yeah. So with nearside, you're able to angle yourself sort of 45Â° and then wait in the middle, whereas offside, you wait in a straight position."
yeah okay so whenever you're ready we're going to get started,68.32,71.36,61,13,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=68,2 - The situation is not critical at all as the car has not moved yet and they are just getting started with the lesson.,"Yeah, okay.

okay we're going to take the next road on the left just after the um should i take this on a first gear um one look when we get close to using mirrors though one approach and signal start breaking are there any parked cars on the entrance we can just take it in a second just break enough and turn it in good if it's a narrow entrance or there are parked cars on approach and you can't see into the road then take it in first so turn left in here again so again break as much as you need start turning in try and use pull and push on the steering there so you're not crossing your arms over,117.92,165.12,590,126,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=117,"Critical level: 4 - While there are potential obstacles to be aware of, such as parked cars, the road situation appears to be relatively clear and manageable.","Okay, we're going to take the next road on the left, just after the um...

what should we do with that great oh he's turning take the road on the right just there now this one here looks like a tighter entrance so slow down as much as you need yeah now get that clutch up slowly it will help you with the turn thank you and turn with both hands again good try and avoid crossing your arms if you can so does that turn easier now just press ok on the screen to get rid of that message that you will need to fill up fuel at some point think about what's happening with the man we've got lots of hazards on the road this morning straight ahead all right yeah straight up straight ahead from here yeah think about the position you want to be in by the end right and a bit of a fast approach there really carefully really carefully here did you realize you were going to be stopping at the end there um not too right at the end but did you realize you were on the side uh yeah yeah so you can see the hazard line,191.28,272.4,932,193,W9LsbUVb3f4,2495,https://youtu.be/W9LsbUVb3f4?t=191,"Critical level: 7

There is also a warning about needing to fill up fuel and the learner approaching the end of the road with a fast approach.","What should we do with that? Oh, he's turning. Take the road on the right, just there. Now, this one here looks like a tighter entrance, so slow down as much as you need. Yeah, now get that clutch up slowly. It will help you with the turn. Thank you. And turn with both hands. Again, good try and avoid crossing your arms if you can. So, does that turn easier now? Just press ""OK"" on the screen to get rid of that message that you will need to fill up fuel at some point. Think about what's happening with the man. We've got lots of hazards on the road this morning. Straight ahead, all right? Yeah, straight up straight ahead from here. Yeah, think about the position you want to be in by the end. Right, and a bit of a fast approach there. Really carefully, really carefully here. Did you realize you were going to be stopping at the end there? Um, not too right at the end, but did you realize you were on the side? Yeah, yeah. So, you can see the hazard line."

We want to make sure we maintain a good distance from the vehicle ahead just in case we need to stop for any reason. You've got more time. Is anyone behind us? Regular mirror checks have been driving okay. So you see the road on the left here, we're not turning in, but imagine we were turning in there.

hi guys welcome to my youtube channel my name is aman and this is max max has his driving test coming up in about a week's time just under a week's time yeah um and today we're working on um meeting and clearance and some mini roundabouts so i just want to see how you um driving all and do all these things on your own today okay so if there's any points that you need my help you can just ask but i'm just gonna do it like normal driving where i'll just talk you through it if need be but i am getting you to do all of it on your own at the moment yeah okay so whenever you're ready we'll get started,19.359,49.84,602,136,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=19,2 - The driving situation is not critical at all. It's a routine driving lesson where the instructor is letting the student practice some maneuvers ahead of their upcoming driving test.,"Hi guys, welcome to my Youtube channel. My name is Aman and this is Max. Max has his driving test coming up in about a week's time, just under a week's time, yeah. Today, we're working on meeting and clearance and some mini roundabouts. So, I just want to see how you're driving, all and do all these things on your own today. Okay, so if there's any points that you need my help, you can just ask, but I'm just gonna do it like normal driving, where I'll just talk you through it if need be. But, I am getting you to do all of it on your own at the moment, yeah? Okay. So, whenever you're ready, we'll get started."
so in that case i think they actually wanted to park behind us when you're parking parked up like that don't signal when you're not actually ready to go imagine you had um traffic flowing behind you and you signaled that might actually cause them to slow down and stop for you yep okay so we're working on meeting clearance and some mini roundabouts from here oh that was a bit tight wasn't it it was what did we say about meeting earlier uh sorry clearance how much space do we like around the vehicle like a meter a meter on the sides yeah and in front and behind two two car lengths so you've got that nice oval shape sort of bubble as soon as you feel like your space is being invaded a little bit you have to slow down and consider whether you need to stop yeah there's no kind of squeezing through okay so when we get to that roundabout let's turn right it's the third exit,74.72,146.64,879,183,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=74,"4 - The driving situation is not very critical at this moment. The student and instructor are discussing parking and meeting/clearance distance, and preparing to make a turn at a roundabout.","So, in that case, I think they actually wanted to park behind us. When you're parking parked up like that, don't signal when you're not actually ready to go. Imagine you had traffic flowing behind you and you signaled. That might actually cause them to slow down and stop for you. Yep. Okay, so we're working on meeting clearance and some mini roundabouts from here. Oh, that was a bit tight, wasn't it? It was. What did we say about meeting earlier? Oh, sorry, clearance. How much space do we like around the vehicle? Like a meter on the sides and in front and behind, two car lengths. So you've got that nice oval shape, sort of bubble. As soon as you feel like your space is being invaded a little bit, you have to slow down and consider whether you need to stop. Yeah, there's no kind of squeezing through. Okay, so when we get to that roundabout, let's turn right. It's the third exit."
hmm that was better i thought um if that door had stayed open we would have had a harder time getting through there,168.84,177.84,115,24,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=168,"Criticality: 4 - The situation could have been more critical if the door had stayed open and caused obstruction, but it was still a potential hazard that required caution.","Hmm, that was better, I thought. Um, if that door had stayed open, we would have had a harder time getting through there."
okay take the next road on the left it's just after this white van now we can't see the road,197.28,203.76,92,22,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=197,"6 - While the direction is clear, the inability to fully see the road increases the criticality of the situation.","Okay, take the next road on the left. It's just after this white van. Now, we can't see the road."
all right you dealt with that nicely but we were turning in quite wide we were yeah yeah you slowed right down why didn't you start steering earlier um it's good to see more inside the road yeah but you don't want to be in the path either so we still had some space on the left that we could have turned into this road can be tricky with meeting situations as the parking lot so the spaces are limited so they're really sort of looking out in case someone is ahead,222.64,261.28,464,96,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=222,"Critical level: 6 

The situation is moderately critical as the road can be tricky with limited spaces in meetings and the driver needs to be aware of the path and not get into any accidents.","All right, you dealt with that nicely. But we were turning in quite wide. We were. Yeah, yeah. You slowed right down. Why didn't you start steering earlier? Um, it's good to see more inside the road, yeah, but you don't want to be in the path either. So we still had some space on the left that we could have turned into. This road can be tricky with meeting situations as the parking lot. So the spaces are limited, so they're really sort of looking out in case someone is ahead."
judge of this you are in second gear so change we have got enough space by the way just slowly take your time with it yeah if you're not sure you can reverse good okay now consider how much space there is over here it's good that you stopped for him but he really didn't have any space to get through with you there yeah and then you put yourself in even more trouble i did yeah okay now take the next road on the left it's just opposite the red car on approach to this left turn max slows down well and leans forward while turning as he cannot see into the road consider turning in a bit slower i know you were breaking but once that cart ended maybe you should have gone down to basket so like going into that corner now we're sort of in the middle of the road because of where the parked cars are lean forward and use the reflections on the left good and again the same goes for this next bit is anybody in the reflections on the right hand,294.96,374.8,943,194,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=294,"Criticality rating: 5
The situation is somewhat critical as the driver needs to be cautious while taking the left turn, which is opposite the red car, and lean forward to use reflections to identify any cars coming.","? If not, we can turn in a bit sharper. Remember to check the blind spot before turning. Okay, now we're going to do a parallel park. Start by pulling up alongside the car in front of the space you want to park in. Make sure you leave enough space between the two cars. Turn the wheel all the way to the left and slowly start reversing into the space. Keep checking your mirrors and blind spot. Once your back wheel is level with the back of the car next to you, turn the wheel all the way to the right and continue reversing. Straighten up the car once you're fully in the space. Good, now we're going to do an emergency stop. When I say stop, I want you to brake as hard as you can without skidding. Stop! Okay, good. That was a bit harsh, but not bad. Remember to keep both hands on the wheel at all times. Now, let's go back to the test center."
we side quite lucky there you actually get stuck on this road now turn right at that roundabout again thinking about the clearance we've talked about [Music] okay just before that roundabout in terms of clearance the space around your car was okay but i feel like you're still doing things a little too fast how do you no no i agree yeah definitely yeah yeah yeah so as soon as you saw that car had turned up maybe we should have gone down to fast gear and slowed down some more yeah like they're only going to enter once you're out the way right there's no right there's no point of view rushing out the way then,379.759,429.919,613,128,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=379,"I would rate this situation a 6 because there were potential clearance issues and the driver was going too fast, which could have potentially led to a dangerous situation.","We're quite lucky there, you actually got stuck on this road.

But I feel like you're still doing things a little too fast. How do you know? No, I agree. Yeah, definitely, yeah. Yeah. So, as soon as you saw that car had turned up, maybe we should have gone down to a lower gear and slowed down some more. Yeah, like they're only going to enter once you're out of the way, right? There's no point of rushing out of the way then."
can we see anything ahead of this guy should we drop back then again we're traveling at about that two-car gap if he suddenly stops it's harder for you when we get to that round about turn right it's quite a sharp turn this one i thought for a second we're on the crossing but we're not there it's all right just watch that cyclist because he's not going to hold his arm up the whole time now with this roundabout you kind of have to go over the roundabout a little bit okay don't try to go around it completely just the right hand side tires not like that just we had a bit more space than that yeah carry on so the right hand side ties especially the back one will go over it so we're gonna go down some more of the narrow roads around here i need to see you slowing down when you see tighter gaps and especially if someone else turns up don't just push through yeah remember,469.28,542.08,877,187,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=469,"I would rate the driving situation as a 7 out of 10, as the instructor mentions the need to watch out for a cyclist and the sharp turn ahead, and also advises the learner to slow down in tighter gaps and when others turn up.","Can we see anything ahead of this guy? Should we drop back? Then again, we're traveling at about that two-car gap. If he suddenly stops, it's harder for you. When we get to that roundabout, turn right. It's quite a sharp turn. This one, I thought for a second we're on the crossing, but we're not. There, it's all right. Just watch that cyclist because he's not going to hold his arm up the whole time. Now, with this roundabout, you kind of have to go over the roundabout a little bit, okay? Don't try to go around it completely, just the right-hand side tires. Not like that, just we had a bit more space than that. Yeah, carry on. So, the right-hand side tires, especially the back one, will go over it. So, we're going to go down some more of the narrow roads around here. I need to see you slowing down when you see tighter gaps, and especially if someone else turns up. Don't just push through. Remember."
earlier when we had that black car back in chiswick right at the beginning where the space was there but again you were just nipping through quite quickly so you just need to slow things down yeah the road ahead has parked cars on both sides max approaches slowly positioning on the left in order to give way leaving enough clearance from the vehicle ahead before proceeding take the next road on the left now think about what we've been talking about now,544.32,589.44,455,88,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=544,Criticality: 2 - The situation is not very critical as there are parked cars on both sides and the instructor is guiding the driver on how to approach the situation safely.,"Earlier, when we had that black car back in Chiswick, right at the beginning, where the space was there, but again, you were just nipping through quite quickly.

so [Music] again don't put yourself on the other side really good position using forward there as well hold on turn left just in here good speed and position there okay well done,616.839,653.2,178,36,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=616,Critical level: 3.

again don't try and prioritize changing gear first slow it down as much as you need and then change gear when you have time okay like with these two guys in the road think about your speed okay because as we're driving through they might just move out into the road again turn left here,692.88,709.76,286,57,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=692,"Critical level: 3.

okay can two cars fit in this space yeah they could okay can you fit with um a bus or a lorry no it would not be ideal you would have to stop if they're coming through or they'll stop for you if you're already committed or if the driver ahead is really fast that would also be another reason for you to possibly start okay we're going down again to a few of the narrow streets some of the ones that we've already been on i need you to be really careful with some of the points and maybe consider stopping instead of just pushing through really well done there good so you slowed down and moved left when we get to that roundabout let's turn left [Music] it's good but again i would have personally gone down to first giver for the turn into the yeah oh it's quite tight yeah you got parked cars on both sides yeah what's to say the road is actually clear could have been a car or a motorbike coming through right yeah,784.839,893.68,917,195,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=784,"Critical level: 7 - The driving situation is quite critical as the student needs to be careful on narrow streets and consider stopping instead of pushing through.

now what about that van he's sticking,916.56,916.56,37,8,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=916,"out a bit into our lane, so we need to move over a little to give him more room, but it's not a dangerous situation.

not bad okay so what are the um things we need to work on a little bit more uh definitely the speed um of which i'm approaching some some meeting situations um not so much the meeting situations it's uh yeah you could say for the meeting situation says well actually because earlier with the van on the other road and it's the the clearance as you're turning into a like a small road with parked cars we haven't really had um anyone suddenly turn up but that's how you want to approach it imagine you're turning in and someone suddenly turns up would you be able to deal with that safely yeah and you also want to think about the way we're approaching and if the person behind you would actually have enough time to react as well yeah yeah okay so we're going to try a few more of these roads around here um about five minutes i'm not saying anything and again i want to see you slowing down for those gaps a bit more just don't take any chances,1001.519,1057.76,945,194,po0NSynUXws,1357,https://youtu.be/po0NSynUXws?t=1001,"Criticality: 5 - The situation is not very critical, but the learner needs to work on approaching meeting situations and turning into small roads with parked cars, especially in scenarios where sudden turns can happen.

Then, just because it could be coming past or, yeah, in case someone's trying to pass on your left, right? Yeah. Now, on that last roundabout, there isn't really enough space for two lanes, but usually, that's where you'd have two lanes. Yeah, and we would want to be on the outer lane at that point.

We're not going to change at 10-12. We're going to change later. Of course, why would we want to change gears later? Um, straight into third, move? No, no, no. We don't want to lose too much power. If we do, think about why you would want to accelerate more in first gear, just so you're already moving at a quicker speed. That's it.

Even if they're a little bit further, I'm not sure. I would have still stopped there because it is a junction, not a slip road. Even if it was a slip road, you want to slow down, let them through if they're at that speed, and then move in behind them and then speed up again. Okay, and then we had, what other roundabout could we improve on? Oh, the White Hart Roundabout when we took the exit for Heathrow. That left mirror check, why does that need to be? What does that mirror need to check? If there's someone there. Yeah, so it's still your lane, isn't it? But it's just in case somebody is pushing through, thinking it's their lane, straight line in the roundabout. Okay, um, then we had the Osterley Garden Roundabout where we were taking a right turn, third exit, and your sort of lanes were all over the place in that one. Yeah."
yeah yeah so if we had more traffic around us you would have found that trickier yeah the good thing on that particular roundabout was you were using your mirrors so it wasn't concerned that you'd move in front of someone because you were checking to make sure it was safe but we did get into the wrong lane so when we first started you're in the correct position as you went in you should have gone round and noticed that okay well i'm taking the third and the first is just gone so the first lane on the left was to the second exit and then as we went forward that divided into two and then you were on the right there so we shouldn't have been on that first half at all we should have been the second half it was marked but it was slightly faded so that's probably why you didn't notice yeah yeah yeah and then from there when you know you're definitely leaving try and get all the way left okay yeah yeah all right,1576.72,1620.72,918,191,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=1576,"I would rate the driving situation as 6, as the student driver made a mistake and entered the incorrect lane, but the traffic was moderate and they were using their mirrors properly.","Yeah, yeah.

But we did get into the wrong lane. So when we first started, you were in the correct position. As you went in, you should have gone around and noticed that, ""Okay, well, I'm taking the third, and the first is just gone."" So the first lane on the left was to the second exit, and then as we went forward, that divided into two. And then you were on the right there. So we shouldn't have been on that first half at all.

and let's talk a little bit about the hesitation on this last roundabout so firstly you stalled when you tried to move off yeah why did it switch off i i just didn't accelerate enough yes and also the clutch it was just completely off so you have to accelerate on that one yeah and then the clutch has to be steady on the lighting point yeah to get that position um into the roundabout the entry and the hesitation it wasn't that bad because a guy next to you also just sat there a little while but there were a few gaps that we could have taken like the one before the green car i think yeah so you know we're crossing three lanes there now in busier traffic you need to make sure all three lanes are clear because you're crossing all three together but at the moment we sort of had what somebody in the first lane somebody in the middle lane and somebody in the top lane now we're going to cross the first lane fairly quickly aren't we so if somebody's in the first lane,1621.279,1670.64,972,201,Cfu5vPY6QWU,1712,https://youtu.be/Cfu5vPY6QWU?t=1621,"Critical level: 4 - While there were a few gaps that could have been taken, the hesitation and entry into the roundabout wasn't that bad, but caution is still needed as we were crossing three lanes.",", we need to be aware of them and make sure they're going to stop for us the moment we go so that we can go across that lane and get into the middle lane and then from there check the top lane and make sure it's clear and then continue on through the roundabout.

A few things you have to keep into consideration when you come to take your test. Make sure you bring your provisional license with you, otherwise they will not let you take it. So make sure you have that in a safe place in your handbag. 

Next thing is, when you start your test, make sure you stay relaxed. Just take a few deep breaths, take your time, nobody's rushing you. If you relax, you're more likely to do better. If you get hyped up, you'll probably make more mistakes. 

Next thing is to just concentrate on what you're doing. Listen carefully to what the instructor says, especially all the safety mirrors and stuff like that. He'll tell you before you move off. Always check your mirrors before you start, before you do anything. It's really vital that you know what's going on around you. 

Next thing is with the steering, just grip the steering wheel, don't have your hand over the rim. And make sure you know what the road signs mean. That's really vital. If you don't know what the road signs mean, probably fail. So make sure you know what they are. 

Yeah, and good luck with your test. I'm not sure this video will make any difference to the test result, but hopefully it gives you a little bit more confidence. So good luck, and let me know how you get on. Thank you."

Can you please show me your driver's license and proof of insurance. Thank you. Today, we will be testing your ability to safely operate a motor vehicle on the road. We will start with some basic maneuvers, such as parallel parking and lane changes. Then we will move on to some more complex tasks, such as merging onto the freeway and navigating through heavy traffic. Throughout the test, I will be assessing your ability to stay aware of your surroundings, follow traffic signals and signs, and make safe and efficient driving decisions. Are you ready to begin? Great, let's get started. Please buckle up and adjust your mirrors before we begin. Okay, first we will start with some basic maneuvers. Please exit the parking lot and make a right turn onto the road. Once on the road, please make a left turn at the first traffic light. Remember to use your turn signal and check your blind spots before turning. Okay, great job. Now let's move onto the next section of the test."

Another issue was your speed. You were driving quite fast in some areas, especially on the narrow roads. Remember to adjust your speed according to the road conditions and always be aware of your surroundings.

Your observation skills also need work. There were a few times where you didn't check your mirrors or look around before making a turn or changing lanes. Always make sure to check your mirrors and blind spots before maneuvering.

Finally, you need to be more confident in your driving. There were times where you hesitated or didn't make a decision, which can lead to confusion for other drivers. Trust your instincts and make clear and decisive maneuvers.

Overall, there's definitely room for improvement, but with practice and focus on these areas, I'm sure you'll pass your driving test in no time."

And then, once he gets out the way, if somebody had been stuck behind him, they can get through. You sort of stopped in the middle. Yeah.

So generally looking all around, making sure there are no people. And as you're reversing, you're mainly going to be looking out the back window this way and the left mirror, but every so often over your right shoulder. Okay, now what about the camber of the road? How does that affect the way we park? Well, what happens when you get closer to the pavement? Because it starts rolling, it will start rolling. Now, how are you going to overcome that? By brake by clutch control, and then brake. Yeah, so the clutch control can only do so much, but because the car is rolling at that point, so once you're rolling, you're gonna have to use the brake a little bit."

How did you end up too far? Uh, just switch off the engine and turn the camera on for a second. Brilliant. Yes. So what reference made you turn too far down the pavement? Now, a triangle, triangle.

this this position here from the pavement is actually due to that triangle reference yeah and remember when you're looking at that mirror because you're sitting so far to the right you can't see the back tire can you but i can so when you're sitting there you've got to make sure you lean across and lift your head up because if you just so you can see that tight so you can see the back tire a bit more because that's where the gap has to close yeah so try and lean across lift your head up a bit more and once it really closes or even wait a second after it's disappeared and then turn okay because it's mainly that reference that we could have improved on yeah and the other thing was the angle wasn't quite 45 yeah so because of that we were traveling for ages and the triangle was still visible which is probably what misled you a little bit so you're probably thinking oh i need to turn by now and just,1796.0,1842.24,908,189,1zF_GhGeoBI,2079,https://youtu.be/1zF_GhGeoBI?t=1796,"I would rate this situation as a 5 - it's important to pay attention to the mirror and use the reference triangle, but it's not an immediate danger.","This position here from the pavement is actually due to that triangle reference.

No, because we can always move back to the left one safe. Yeah, so you want to be a bit more defensive about your drive, whether you're in the middle and it's your priority, just check, ""Okay, I can't believe that van driver. He's really weaving in and out."" Yeah, he was driving really badly. He wasn't a good driver. But that's the type of driver that you need to be alert about.

Okay, yeah, just if it's safe to do so, move over. It's annoying because it has a straight arrow but it says ""Harrow"", which is the first exit only. So, this lane actually takes you a lot better to the lane you want to be in. As Sammy moves off from this position, he checks his mirrors towards the left. As he's moving across to the left a little bit, this happens in every roundabout, so it's always a good idea to use your left mirror as you enter, as sometimes vehicles from the left may straight line the roundabout."

8 - This is a fairly critical driving situation as the roundabout is big and there is a lot of traffic crossing the dual carriageway, resulting in potentially long waits. Additionally, there is a lane split which requires the driver to be in the correct lane. The mistake made by Sami in not using his left mirror could also lead to an accident.","On approach to this roundabout, the second exit is straight ahead at 12 o'clock. You need to start off in the left-hand lane. On approach, as you go forward, the left-hand lane splits into two, and you need to be in the middle as the left one goes left only. This is a very big roundabout. Majority of the traffic on the roundabout simply crosses the dual carriageway going left and right. Therefore, sometimes you have to have a very long wait before you can go in. As soon as you move off from this position, you need to move straight back to the island on the left-hand side to get back into the left-hand lane to exit the roundabout. 

As Sami goes into the roundabout, he goes forward into the roundabout, as opposed to going around straight into his lane. As nobody was on the right as he went forward, this was not a serious fault. He should also use his left mirror as he goes forward, as somebody may be using the left."

Because when we went slowing down from that 40 miles per hour road we were in, I think fourth gear, and the first thing you did is you put the clutch down and tried changing gears.

[Music] hi guys and welcome back to clearview driving today i'm doing a lesson for matthew now matthew has his test coming up in two days time i am doing the lesson in his car so i don't have the controls on my side um if anything happens i can't really do much besides tell you to stop okay so he hasn't driven in this area before so today's lesson is just to get a nice little introduction on all the different little junctions making sure that you're driving safely yeah just get familiar with the area a little bit so whenever you're ready we're gonna get started [Music] okay so we're gonna follow signs to slow from here all right,0.0,57.84,636,138,S6S4yi6900E,2345,https://youtu.be/S6S4yi6900E?t=0,Critical level: 3 - The driving situation is not very critical as the focus is on familiarizing the student with the area and getting an introduction to different junctions.,"[Music] Hi guys, and welcome back to Clearview Driving.

i just put that signal on slightly earlier about six to eight columns away have it on so a lot of the roads around here like this we're just driving out in the country yeah we had that national sign as we entered oh does that apply that one yeah all right as in oh yeah we had another sign just here oh i did not see that yeah um but yeah no streetlamps so i should be going if it's safe to drive at 60 drive at 60 at the moment it's probably only safe let's say 40 yeah yeah so as long as you're not driving 20 you'll be fine okay driving down country lanes always look out for road signs as they may be hidden behind trees and bushes do as best as you can the signs are partly sort of hidden because of the trees overgrown so you've got to keep looking out for signs now there's your new speed limit coming in again partly hidden,75.04,165.84,831,185,S6S4yi6900E,2345,https://youtu.be/S6S4yi6900E?t=75,"Criticality: 3.

yeah these birds are so bad especially in a small car a good combination okay the sign board's slightly covered up again but slow is straight ahead there are two roundabouts all right so it's like a right left okay there's lots of ropes to consider what should we do for the first bit so it's just up there yeah that's the way we heard i'm keeping on that second car because his signal's hidden isn't it,181.84,223.68,403,86,S6S4yi6900E,2345,https://youtu.be/S6S4yi6900E?t=181,"Criticality: 5 - The situation is somewhat critical as there are two roundabouts and the signboard is slightly covered up, but the instructor and student are discussing and taking necessary precautions.","Yeah, these birds are so bad, especially in a small car.

Good, but yeah, you should have been on the right. The guy behind, same thing; he came into the same lane as you, so it's not an issue, but he could have very easily positioned on the right. Yeah. And then, okay, now looking at the diagram in the distance, I want to say signs to Slough. Alright, I'm guessing on this one, but I think it is yes, to the left. Okay, Matthew deals with the two cyclists ahead really well, but keeps his distance.

good matthew didn't notice this was a roundabout and carries on straight without looking matthew did you look right on that roundabout the this right here when we did yeah not not the first one but the second one no i saw the stop lights and i just went straight ahead okay you should have looked right there was a car on your right but he was going left okay but if you completely miss a roundabout and you do not look right you will get a serious fault for that okay you know when i showed you the signs for slough did you know there were two roundabouts i saw two on the sign yeah but i thought they were i was in the left one already okay so the first roundabout was a left turn wasn't it yeah okay and the second round about was a straight so you still need you just needed to look across to the right that's that was it okay now when we get to the next roundabout we're gonna take the second exit,1379.28,1442.84,902,194,S6S4yi6900E,2345,https://youtu.be/S6S4yi6900E?t=1379,"Critical level: 7.

no signal per second and i'll approach stick to the left lane have a look then we're gonna head in outside outside lane outside good and then after the first exit use the left mirror also there we are so on approach there's no signal it's all right couldn't do anything about it no okay i'm glad you didn't swerve that suddenly because that would have been dangerous okay so if you're taking the first exit on a big roundabout you would signal left on approach and keep that on yeah okay if you're taking the second exit you would have no signal until until you pass the first one but if that second exit is past 12 o'clock you would now signal right to begin and a left when you hit just drive a little bit slower down here zero advisory signs up saying max 20. it's not compulsory it's advisory,1471.679,1534.4,796,169,S6S4yi6900E,2345,https://youtu.be/S6S4yi6900E?t=1471,"Critical level: 1

If the traffic light is green, obviously we can keep on going. If the traffic light is yellow, you're going to slowly brake to come to a stop. If it's a red light, you must come to a stop. You don't want to roll over the crosswalk or the stop line too much. Give yourself about a foot behind the car in front of you. And pay attention to your surroundings as well.

Sure, I would turn on the ignition and then turn on my headlights. Then I would get out of the car and walk around to the front and back of the car to check that theyâre working.

Yeah, again, left lane was available. Then when we went into the roundabout, we were taking the second exit for Chizik. Now, that's when you said to me, ""Am I taking second exit, and where is it?""

Yeah, it wasn't much of an emergency, was it? Yes. I tried to, yeah, yeah. Okay, your emergency stop was too weak. I had to ask you to do it again. Now, even the second time, it didn't feel like, you know, you would jump forward. What you're doing with the emergency stop is your clutch is going down too soon, and the brake is not firm enough. So we ended up stopping, like, taking ages to stop. Yeah, yeah. So you just need to brake firmer. You need to do that. Imagine if a child comes running out in front of you. Would you brake like that?

at the very beginning you need to look all around okay because that mirror doesn't cover this area here so if someone had stepped into the road from that section yeah it's now a big issue because you wouldn't see them in that mirror until a lot later so with that blind spot check on the first initial move off you didn't look around and then when you went forward you didn't really look behind again so it's a bit you know there's a few key points on that one um then the other faults that i've got a few minors that were kept sort of reoccurring firstly whenever you've turned left there's a few three encounters where i can remember completely we're turning left and you're not using your mirrors before signaling and on that particular turn you haven't been checking even after you've signaled so some of the left mirror checks you sort of signal and then you're checking and others you're not checking at all okay on the right you're definitely always,2193.119,2239.52,956,194,qMWUh6b43tE,2638,https://youtu.be/qMWUh6b43tE?t=2193,at a 7 - The blind spot check is critical to avoid potential accidents and the failure to consistently use mirrors before signaling and checking after signaling could lead to unsafe lane changes or turns.,looking in the mirror before signaling which is good but on the left you need to make sure you're doing that as well because obviously people can come up from behind you and it's just a safety check that you need to do every time you're turning regardless of which way you're going then the other minor that were reoccurring were just observation and anticipation um so especially at roundabouts just making sure that you're looking in the right place and you're anticipating what other drivers might be doing so if there's a car on your right and it's indicating to go left you need to look and make sure that they're actually doing that before you just go or if there's a car that's waiting to come onto the roundabout you need to look and make sure that they're not going to pull out in front of you so that's just about observation and anticipation which is something you can work on okay so those are the key points for feedback then okay how do you feel it went today apart from those mistakes i thought it went okay yeah okay good okay just lower your window for us please let's pass your certificate over okay so well done today thank you for that

While there was a tricky situation with a right turn, overall the driving situation was not very critical as the learner driver was keeping up with the speed of the road, handling turns at traffic lights well, and navigating surroundings nicely.","correct. However, the arrow changes when you get closer to the junction and it becomes a right turn only lane which is why we couldn't go straight but had to turn right instead. Other than that, your observation and awareness were good, you checked your mirrors and blind spots regularly and didn't make any dangerous or reckless manoeuvres. Your steering and control of the vehicle was also fine. However, there were a few minor faults such as not checking your mirrors before signalling, not positioning your car correctly at times and not using your handbrake when parked. These are things that you can easily improve on with practice. Overall, it was a decent drive and with a bit more work on these areas, you should be able to pass your test soon."
why you got a bit confused going well where has he gone but yeah if you can see it's the right arrow we're just going to go around the top of that moped okay and then wait until the road ahead is clear but you dealt with that nicely and when you turned into the new road you made sure you went into the first lane which is the left lane and you were up to the speed of the road no trouble on that road at all so yeah all of that was good um what else was that even when we came off the uh slip road on the dual carriageway there were two lanes to turn and you were in the first of the two lanes and then when you moved off from that position you made sure you stayed on the left and the turn so that was really good and sometimes people may start in the left lane and then when they're turning they just turn straight over but you didn't do that that was all really good a lot of good use of mirrors towards the,2379.28,2421.04,911,200,qMWUh6b43tE,2638,https://youtu.be/qMWUh6b43tE?t=2379,end of the clip.

right it's just the left hand side was a little bit off which i i noticed that most often with anyone that's been driving like experienced drivers because you're closer to the right you'll check that one away whereas the left you don't check it as much but the reason you want to check the left as much this much is because more driving on these 20 roads cyclists so many cyclists cyclists cyclists motorbikes they turn up very quickly don't they and yeah they can just come up and through any small gap and they'll be through so that's why these left mirror checks were sort of vital in places yeah oh another thing i remembered um do you remember when we were waiting on the other road parked up and there was a bit of traffic behind us and you'd signal to move off and then that motorbike gave you away yeah so with that there was traffic flowing you've signaled to go which is fine but when they're when there's traffic flowing,2422.88,2468.48,931,191,qMWUh6b43tE,2638,https://youtu.be/qMWUh6b43tE?t=2422,"Critical level: 8. 

The situation is critical because there are many cyclists and motorbikes on the road and they can quickly appear from the left side, which is often overlooked by experienced drivers. Left mirror checks are vital in these areas to avoid accidents. Additionally, the previous situation where a motorbike gave away the driver's intention to move off was a potential danger in flowing traffic.","Right, it's just the left-hand side was a little bit off, which I noticed that most often with anyone that's been driving, like experienced drivers, because you're closer to the right, you'll check that one away. Whereas the left, you don't check it as much, but the reason you want to check the left as much is because more driving on these 20 roads, cyclists, so many cyclists, cyclists, cyclists, motorbikes. They turn up very quickly, don't they? And yeah, they can just come up and through any small gap, and they'll be through. So that's why these left mirror checks were sort of vital in places. Yeah, oh, another thing I remembered. Do you remember when we were waiting on the other road parked up, and there was a bit of traffic behind us, and you'd signal to move off? And then that motorbike gave you away, yeah. So with that, there was traffic flowing. You've signaled to go, which is fine. But when there's traffic flowing..."
be prepared to go if you want to move in front of them so what happened there is the motorbike gave you way and you were like oh wait he's giving me away so if you're signaling he's they're most likely to give way and if they do you've got to be ready to go but you dealt with that fairly quickly so again no issues but be prepared if you can see this traffic and you don't really want to go before them just wait for your signal put it on when you want to go okay that's good yeah let's go work on some of these things and yes all right so one last mistake that i wanted to talk about and that was the traffic light right turn yes so um with that one when the lights were green the traffic in front of you moved but we could see the bus and the new road wasn't moving so there's no point of us going forward so what happened there is you've gone past past the stop line and after that there's a cycle box and a crossing box,2470.079,2516.16,924,205,qMWUh6b43tE,2638,https://youtu.be/qMWUh6b43tE?t=2470,"Critical level: 8 - The situation at the traffic light right turn could potentially be dangerous as there was a cycle box and a crossing box after the stop line, and the traffic ahead was not moving.",".

So, if you're signaling, they're most likely to give way. And, if they do, you've got to be ready to go. But you dealt with that fairly quickly, so again, no issues. But be prepared. If you can see this traffic, and you don't really want to go before them, just wait for your signal. Put it on when you want to go. Okay, that's good. Yeah, let's go work on some of these things. And, yes, alright. So, one last mistake that I wanted to talk about, and that was the traffic light right turn. So, with that one, when the lights were green, the traffic in front of you moved, but we could see the bus and the new road wasn't moving. So, there's no point of us going forward.

now neither of those two spaces we should have been in i have to tell you to stop because if we went any further we would have now been blocking the road i don't think you were going to go forward anyways but it's just the point we're out we shouldn't be there now the reason that's a serious fault is because we should have noticed what was happening and waited behind the stop line the position that we're in if a bus or a lorry tries to come round that corner we're in the space that they'd be turning from so sometimes at these traffic lights you find advanced stop lines so the stop line is a lot further than the actual junction which is what we had there okay um besides that how do you feel about some of the mini roundabouts now that we've practiced through them yeah they've been great um it's definitely really helpful to go through them again and again yeah um to just see like because what you kept doing,2517.92,2561.44,917,190,qMWUh6b43tE,2638,https://youtu.be/qMWUh6b43tE?t=2517,"Critical level: 8 - The situation was critical as being in the wrong position at a traffic light junction, especially where there are advanced stop lines, can cause serious accidents especially if larger vehicles, such as buses or lorries, are there as well.","Now, neither of those two spaces we should have been in.

The position that we're in, if a bus or a lorry tries to come around that corner, we're in the space that they'd be turning from. So sometimes at these traffic lights, you find advanced stop lines, so the stop line is a lot further than the actual junction, which is what we had there.

Yeah, go quicker.

Although Eloise did check her mirrors before moving to the right, there was a vehicle on the right that was affected by her, so that would go down as a dangerous fault.

here to come off at heathrow so what should we do to come off okay now as you come off i want you to keep right always avoid puddles you want to get your brakes wet um all right on the roundabout we're taking the fourth exit towards heathrow do you wanna try slowing and gearing down on your own again yeah yeah so right signal on and then work on the slowing down part always give yourself more time do a block change this time yeah and then get ready to look first have a look nice and quick count on the exits once you're in stay right what exit have we just passed two then why are we moving left yeah we wait for the third one now check left [Music] good just breaking as you're going into that corner okay just really tuck it in okay we'll talk about that in a minute okay we're just going to do a right turn soon so when safe if you could move into the right hand lane that's great yeah,718.56,815.68,893,196,BSbufEViOIc,1767,https://youtu.be/BSbufEViOIc?t=718,"Critical level: 5 - There are some important instructions being given for navigating a roundabout and changing lanes, but the situation is not overly intense or dangerous.","Here to come off at Heathrow, what should we do to come off?

Now when you go forward, you don't have to start the whole thing again, you can just fix it. Which is probably easier, isn't it? Yeah. 

Right, I'm going to go through some of the minor faults that went on. So right at the very beginning, when I asked you to park up, you parked up in front of a driveway, and there was a very clear section where there was no driveway and then there was one driveway. So you went right in front of that drive and stopped. So whenever you're stopping, try not to block driveways. The high curb is what you want to stop next to, okay?

Um, the slip road, you nearly missed your indicator. You put it on, yeah, yeah. I should have done it a little bit earlier. I saw the 40 miles an hour, but I was concentrating on the 20."
then i was like i should have put it quicker yeah but it's okay you did have it on which is nice your lane changes on the carriageway were very nice you're keeping up to the right speed good distance from the vehicles in front also one of the roundabouts i felt like um i changed lanes because i was on the wrong lane yes yes was that okay you did that really well so when you went into that roundabout you started in the overtaking lane which is fine it went there but as soon as you've gone into that roundabout you've gone into the furthest right which actually on the floor says you knew you weren't going to yetings you should have been in the one across yeah now as you went round you've checked and you know you've still carried on in the same lane when you could have just switched over and then when the exit was coming up you checked signaled you checked again safely moved over which is great but now let's say on that particular,1863.2,1906.64,940,199,o3yjecrYTic,2076,https://youtu.be/o3yjecrYTic?t=1863,driving situation is at a 3 as the lane change mistake was minor and was corrected safely.,"Then I was like, ""I should have done it quicker,"" but it's okay.

The road ahead has parked vehicles on both sides. There's still enough space for two vehicles to pass at the same time, but it's not ideal. So, when passing along roads like this, always try and keep an ideal clearance of a meter from the left-hand side. When passing alongside an oncoming vehicle, you have to go slower, as there isn't enough space to leave a meter from the left-hand side, as well as leaving space along the middle of the road.

When passing along roads like this where there are parked vehicles and islands in the middle of the road, be sure to keep regular checks in your mirrors as motorbikes and cyclists may turn up easily.

Critical Level: 7 - This situation is fairly critical as merging onto a busy highway requires careful observation, quick decision-making, and execution of the merge.","So, you're ready for your driving test. Good! Let's go. First thing we're looking for is  good, skillful control of the car at all times. So, put your seatbelt on.
Now, we want to make sure we're safe to move off, so we're going to check our mirrors. After we check our mirrors, we're going to indicate, and we're always going to be looking around to make sure that we can move off safely. So, when it's safe to do so, we'll get the car moving.
So, we're driving along now, and we want to be comfortable and confident on the road. That means being in the right position on the road, making sensible progress, and anticipating what's going to happen next. So, keep an eye on the road signs and markings, and look out for any other road users who might be around.
When you're driving, you need to be in control at all times. That means no speeding, no drifting from lane to lane, and no sudden movements. Smoothness is key.
Okay, so we're coming up to a junction now. We need to be prepared to stop if we have to and make sure we're in the right gear. So, slow down and be ready to stop if you need to. Remember to check your mirrors and signal if you need to as well.
And that's it! If you can demonstrate good control of the car, stay safe on the road, and be confident and comfortable behind the wheel, you'll have no problem passing your driving test."

Alright, okay so gonna get started. First off we have your driver's license and registration. So let me just take those from you.

Okay, thank you.

All right, first question. What does a yellow traffic light mean?

A yellow traffic light means to slow down and be prepared to stop before entering the intersection.

Okay, good.

Alright, next question. What does a pedestrian crosswalk sign look like?

A pedestrian crosswalk sign is a white stick figure walking on a blue background.

Okay, that's correct.

Now, we're gonna begin the driving portion of the test. I want you to make a right turn at the next intersection.

Alright.

Good job on the right turn. Now, let's make a left turn at the next intersection.

Okay.

Good job on the left turn. Now, let's go ahead and park over here on the side of the road.

I'm doing good. How are you?

I'm good, thank you. Ready to pass your test?

Yeah, I hope so.

Okay, so let's get started.

Okay, good job. Now let's turn right here.

[Driver turns right]

Good turn. Now, let's stay in this lane and keep going straight.

[As they drive, the driver checks their mirrors and glances at the speedometer]

Very good. Now, let's turn left at the next street.

[Driver turns left]

Nice work. Let's take this next turn on the right.

[Driver turns right]

Excellent. Now let's pull over and parallel park right here.

That was perfect. You did a great job. Congratulations, you passed your driving test.

To check, you use the indicators, both left and right, and observe the dash from the inside. From the outside, you check the lights. You wouldn't use the hazard lights, only the indicators.

In the driving test, you will be asked to pull over and stop three to four times. Whenever the examiner asks you to pull over, don't pull over in the first space you see.

We're going to go ahead and do my driving test today so make sure you're taking notes because you might learn something new. Alright let's go ahead and get started. 

Okay Sarah so the first thing we're going to do is a pre-drive check so go ahead and put your seatbelt on for me. Now make sure your mirrors are adjusted so you can see everything around you. Alright looks good. 

Now we're going to start the car so put your foot on the brake and turn the key. Good job. Now put the car into drive and let's start moving. 

Alright Sarah now we're going to make a left turn up here so start slowing down a bit. Okay and now turn your signal on to let the other drivers know you're turning. Great, now turn the wheel to the left and let's make this turn. 

Alright now we're going to parallel park so go ahead and start looking for a spot. Once you find a spot, pull up about a car length ahead of the car in front of it. Good. Now put the car in reverse and turn your wheel to the right. Keep going back until your passenger side mirror is lined up with the front car's rear bumper. Perfect, now turn the wheel to the left and keep going back until you're parked straight.

First thing you need to remember is to always drive on the left-hand side of the road. So, left-hand side of the road, not the right-hand side. Now, when you're changing lanes, always make sure that you do a shoulder check just to check that there's no cars in your blind spot. So, you check your left shoulder if you're going left, and your right shoulder if you're going right. Another really important thing is to make sure that you come to a complete stop at any stop sign or red light. You don't wanna just kinda roll through it, you actually wanna come to a complete stop. And finally, when you're parallel parking, just make sure that you take your time, don't rush it. Make sure that you're in the spot and that you're parked properly before you get out. And that's it, those are our driving test tips for today."
with parallel parking if you don't manage to get the maneuver done in one go and you have to go into first gear to go forward to fix this this will go down as a minor fault for control while reversing ashish gets the back tire quite close to the pavement i wanted to go forward to fix this he should have looked around before going forward as there was a vehicle waiting but as he wasn't close to them this wasn't a serious fault but it would be counted as a minor fault thank you so shortly we're going to carry out the emergency stop okay so i'd like you to drive normally along this road i'll make sure that it's clear so you'll see me looking around and i'm going to give you a signal which is stop as soon as you get that signal i'd like you to slow down and stop the car as quickly and as safely as possible okay i will look around our milk i will make sure it's safe you don't need to,1526.24,1580.0,891,194,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=1526,"rate the driving situation in this segment as it mainly involves discussing minor faults and preparing for an emergency stop, with no immediate danger or critical situation present.","worry about that just focus on your driving and stopping as soon as you get the signal. Let's begin. First, let's go over the parallel parking. If you don't manage to complete the maneuver in one go and have to go into first gear to go forward to fix this, it will go down as a minor fault for control while reversing. Ashish got the back tire quite close to the pavement, so I wanted him to go forward to fix this. He should have looked around before going forward, as there was a vehicle waiting. But since he wasn't close to them, this wasn't a serious fault, but it would be counted as a minor fault. Thank you. Shortly, we're going to carry out the emergency stop. Okay, so I'd like you to drive normally along this road. I'll make sure that it's clear, so you'll see me looking around, and I'm going to give you a signal which is ""stop.""

There was a road, but there were parked cars on the right, and we were going through, and then there was a car approaching. Now, there was space for both of you, but as he approached, you moved left and slowed down, which is fine. But there's a motorbike behind us, and you moved. He's moved in behind you, but then, now that the car's gone through, instead of just going straight, you've moved right, but you're checking your mirrors and moving, and the motorbike's also moving around at the same time. Okay, so we didn't need to move like that, even though you're checking."
it's just like it's not necessary to move and be mindful about checking and moving at the same time because you're not kind of reacting to what's there you're sort of just checking and moving because that motorbike what if he tried to get around you a bit quicker there okay yeah so these are some things to bear in mind but in terms of safety the roundabouts and all that the right turns you did really well you were always trying to get into the normal driving lane which is great you kind of definitely knew about that one one thing i realized when there was entrance left yeah i shouldn't have moved actually it was okay yeah yeah i know what you were about there was no any other car so i think that was okay as well true but at the same time that entry that you're thinking about they have a giveaway okay so they have to wait for you it's not a it's not a slip road not a slipper yeah so i'm glad you realize that but on that particular one,2397.04,2444.4,947,200,LTwZw7ZQu50,2604,https://youtu.be/LTwZw7ZQu50?t=2397,"I would say the driving situation is a 3, as the focus is on being mindful of potential risks rather than an immediate safety concern.","It's just like, it's not necessary to move and be mindful about checking and moving at the same time because you're not reacting to what's there.

So, these are some things to bear in mind, but in terms of safety, the roundabouts and all that, the right turns, you did really well. You were always trying to get into the normal driving lane, which is great. You definitely knew about that one. One thing I realized, when there was entrance left, yeah, I shouldn't have moved actually. It was okay. Yeah, yeah, I know what you were about. There was no other car, so I think that was okay as well. True, but at the same time, that entry that you're thinking about, they have a giveaway. So, they have to wait for you.

very brief so i went down as like a minor fault on that one had the lady behind turned in or was affected in any way whatsoever yeah that would have been a serious fault yeah so if if you turn into a new road and there is a traffic light there'll be a clear stop line if that traffic light is for you now usually with them traffic lights as soon as you turn into a new road they're not immediately after the turn there'll be space for at least one if not two cars to be more straight so as you turn in if you get a glimpse of that light it's not for you okay so don't panic yeah well what did you think it was your serious fault besides these i thought at that traffic light well when you got hooted at that one yeah and then also when i like pressed on the brakes yeah and then i kept going and i was like good on me but i knew i was taking you on a really challenging drive i did i did kind of,2172.0,2223.68,895,197,-rmW3Vp8jNQ,2312,https://youtu.be/-rmW3Vp8jNQ?t=2172,"Critical level: 7 - The situation is fairly critical as there was a risk of causing a serious fault if the lady behind had been affected by the driver's mistake in the previous situation, and there is potential for panicking if the driver mistakes the traffic light signal.","rush a bit and forget to check my mirrors a few times which could have been dangerous.

Hello everyone, and welcome to the driving test video. Today we will go through the steps you need to take to pass your driving test.

First, you need to make sure you have all the necessary documents such as your driver's license, vehicle registration, proof of insurance and any other required documents in your state or country.

Next, ensure that the vehicle you will be driving is in good condition, check the brakes, tires, lights, turn signals and horn.

Once you're in the vehicle, adjust your seat and mirrors to your preferred position and fasten your seatbelt.

Before starting the engine, turn on the ignition, press the brake pedal and shift the gear to neutral. You can now start the engine and wait for it to warm up before driving.

When driving, always remember to obey traffic signs, signals and speed limits. Keep a safe distance between other vehicles and use your turn signals when changing lanes or making turns.

Finally, parallel parking is a common skill you may be tested on, so practice this maneuver ahead of time.

And that's it! Follow these steps, obey traffic laws and you will have a good chance of passing your driving test. Good luck!"

[car engine starts] Okay, so the car is started, now we want to put it into drive. Wait for a second and make sure that we're not going to ram into anything, and then slowly press on the gas. We don't want to lurch forward, but we also don't want to be too slow. We want to find that happy medium where we're gradually accelerating but not going too fast. [car engine revs] Okay, so now we're going to make a left turn up ahead. We want to make sure that we're signaling the turn, and also slowing down a bit. [signal ticking] We have to be careful of other cars that might be coming towards us, so always double-check before making the turn. [car turns left] Okay, now that we've made the turn, we want to accelerate back up to the speed limit. We don't want to be the slowpoke on the road, but we also don't want to be speeding. We want to follow the laws and make sure that we're driving safely. Okay, up ahead we have a stop sign. We want to make sure to come to a complete stop before the white line. [car comes to a stop] Okay, now we can proceed cautiously into the intersection. We want to make sure that there are no other cars that are going to hit us, so always check in both directions before moving forward.

traffic lights,1411.52,1411.52,14,2,LfmuCPLcccE,1828,https://youtu.be/LfmuCPLcccE?t=1411,"4 - While traffic lights are an important part of driving, they are not typically considered a highly critical situation as long as drivers follow the rules of the road.","So, this is your driving test, and we're gonna be dealing with traffic lights today.

Now, the first thing to remember when you come to a traffic light is to stop if it's red. If it's green, go ahead and drive. If it's yellow or amber, you need to slow down; that means it's about to turn red.

Now, one thing that people get wrong sometimes is queuing and blocking intersections. You don't want to do that, so make sure you stop before the white line, before you get to the intersection. Otherwise, you could block someone else's way or get hit by a car coming from the other direction.

Another thing to remember is that you should always use your turn signals when turning. If you're going left or right, that means you need to signal to the drivers behind you where you're heading. Also, be aware of the pedestrian crossings, and keep an eye out for the âwalkâ or âdon't walk' signs.

So, that's a brief guide to traffic lights. Remember, stop at red, go at green, slow down at amber or yellow, and always signal your turns. Happy driving!"

So clearly, the traffic lights were out. Oh yes, the traffic lights, they were broken. You kind of didn't notice until very late. ""I did notice very late because I was talking to you guys."" ""You're welcome."" So yeah, there were road markers on the floor even after Amman said. I didn't realize that there were road markers on the floor. I was looking at the traffic lights and scanning the traffic so intently because I know.

up forward and then you've zoomed forward and then he's going around behind you yeah now you can do that because now we can see the road ahead but the right ideal thing to do unless the road markings tell you to go otherwise so if somebody else is kind of doing it the wrong way just don't feel like you've got to copy what they're doing just do it safely do it safely even if you're in the wrong position deal with it safely so if what i did was safe but i disobeyed road marking would that still be the thing you know that traffic light junction yeah the one with the lights out when i was 19 i hadn't had a big accident on that track really yeah i am i went into that offside position which you did okay and there was a bus blocking my view yeah yeah yeah so now i'm sitting in the middle and then i couldn't see any anybody for a while so as i kind of wait you'd have edged,2742.88,2782.48,877,194,cjOkGDCP-Ks,2891,https://youtu.be/cjOkGDCP-Ks?t=2742,"1.

Today we're going to be doing something a little different. We're going to be doing a driving test for my girlfriend. Now, she's been practicing for a while, and I think she's ready to take her test. So, we're just going to show you what the driving test is like.

There's a few things that they're going to be looking for. First of all, they're going to check to make sure that she's got her seatbelt on. They're also going to make sure that she's adjusted the mirrors so that she can see everything behind her. And then they're going to ask her some basic questions like what the speed limit is, what the stop signs look like, and what the rules of the road are.

Then, they're going to test her parallel parking skills. This can be a really tricky part of the test, but I think she's got it down pretty well. The important thing is to take it slow, use your mirrors, and make sure you're not hitting any other cars.

After that, they're going to have her drive on the road for a while. They're going to ask her to make some turns, stop at some lights, and merge onto the freeway. This is probably the most nerve-wracking part of the test, but as long as you stay calm and follow the rules of the road, you should be fine.

So, that's what the driving test is like. It can be a little intimidating, but as long as you're prepared and you're a safe driver, you should pass with flying colors."

be sure to check the bus stop to see if there's any pedestrians getting on and off this will give you an idea to know if the bus is about to move off if the bus is not moving off make sure to look at the road ahead and try and stop at least two to three car lights behind the bar so that you can see the road ahead more clearly and it gives you enough time to get around the bus if it's safe to do so martha didn't realize that the bus was broken down until a little bit later she ends up getting too close to the bus which makes it harder for her to see the road ahead martha is trying to make the most of her seating position to try and lean across to the right to see more of the road ahead but it's difficult with the size of the bus she notices her vehicles coming through so she moves her position back towards the left which ultimately brings her closer to the bus as we're waiting in this position the vehicles behind get impatient and they start overtaking,751.519,809.2,965,204,VHmRRX3bLpc,1660,https://youtu.be/VHmRRX3bLpc?t=751,"7 - The situation is critical because there is a broken down bus on the road and pedestrians may be getting on and off the bus, making it difficult to see the road ahead.

This way, you can see the road ahead more clearly, and it gives you enough time to get around the bus if it's safe to do so. 

Martha didn't realize that the bus was broken down until a little bit later. She ends up getting too close to the bus, which makes it harder for her to see the road ahead. Martha is trying to make the most of her seating position to try and lean across to the right to see more of the road ahead, but it's difficult with the size of the bus. She notices that vehicles are coming through, so she moves her position back towards the left, which ultimately brings her closer to the bus.

Before we begin, please make sure that your driver's license, registration, and insurance are up to date. If you're ready, let's get started.

First, we'll inspect the vehicle. Check the mirrors, turn signals, headlights, brake lights, and horn. Make sure that the seatbelt is properly fastened, and the car is in good working condition. If everything looks good, then we'll move on to the second part of the test, the driving portion.

We will drive through some different routes and scenarios, so please pay attention to all the signs and rules of the road. Make sure to maintain proper speed, use your signals when necessary, and keep a safe distance between you and other vehicles.

Finally, we'll return to the starting point for the post-drive inspection. Check the vehicle once again to make sure that everything is in order, and then we'll conclude the test. If you pass, congratulations! You will soon receive your driver's license. If not, don't worry, you can try again in the near future.

Always make sure that you're checking your mirrors and move over in good time when you're going around buses or overtaking traffic. When driving behind this bus on a dual carriageway, make sure to leave plenty of space in front as the bus will pull over regularly. The more space you have in front, and the earlier you use your mirrors and signal, the easier it will be to pass the bus. Shani deals with the bus on the bus stop really calmly. She ends up getting stuck behind the bus, but she leaves a little bit of space in front. The lane on the right is flowing quite fast, so it's not safe to move over.

Also, when you're moving off you need to make sure you release the handbrake fully and clutch control is key, you don't want to stall the car or roll back. 

Next, let's talk about your clutch control. You need to be a bit smoother with it, try not to let the car jerk forward or stall. You want to find that biting point and gently increase the revs to move off smoothly. Lastly, your observation on roundabouts needs some improvement. You're checking your mirrors and signalling correctly which is good but you need to make sure you're looking at each exit and assessing the traffic before entering the roundabout. Also, when you're exiting you need to signal left before exiting, not on the roundabout. 

Overall, there are some areas that need improvement but keep practicing and I'm sure you'll pass your driving test soon. Good luck!"

Uh, search up on YouTube or something if you don't know. Yeah, but other than that, that's all that's the answer I give, so I've got no clue.

Okay, probably search up online. Okay, that's fine. [Laughter] So, whenever you're ready, let's get started.

In this video we will go through some of the basic maneuvers that you will be tested on during your driving exam. First, you will need to adjust your mirrors to ensure maximum visibility. This includes your rearview mirror and both side mirrors. Remember to fasten your seatbelt before starting the car. Once you have done this, you may start the vehicle and begin your test. You will be asked to perform a series of maneuvers such as parallel parking, three-point turns, and merging onto highways. Remember to always check your blind spots and signal before changing lanes. Keep a safe distance from other vehicles on the road and be sure to obey all traffic signs and signals. When parking, be sure to use your handbrake and turn off the engine. Keep in mind these tips and you will pass your driving test with flying colors. Good luck!"

You should slowly keep moving up until the point of merge and the lane on the right will start to give way. If they don't give way, then you should drop back, and the next car should give way. Just up ahead, Sarah gets a serious fault for response to road markings. She initially stops before the keep clear, but then moves forward and waits fully on the keep clear junction. The keep clear box is for the vehicles from the right-hand side to be able to enter if there's traffic on this road."

The situation is critical as the learner driver made a major fault during the driving test by not following the correct lane discipline while turning right on a busy roundabout.","Okay, if you can keep going a bit further, and then if you can pull and park up on the left just before the speed ramp, but on this road, okay, just on the road, not on the pavement. That's great, though. Thank you. Stop there and secure the car and switch off the engine as well. Thank you. Just give me a few minutes.

Alright, that is the end of your driving test. How was your drive, lobby? I think it was good. Yeah, would you say that there were any concerns at all?

Okay, now unfortunately, it wouldn't be a pass on this occasion, and that's due to one major fault that you had. That was on that roundabout, Greenfield Roundabout, when we had to do it the second time around and you were turning right, weren't you? Yeah. Now, you chose to go into the middle lane as you went into the roundabout. The lights were changing, but that wasn't even the issue. As you're going into the roundabout, there's a bit of a lane discipline issue."
so you're in the middle lane as you're entering you're kind of cutting back in towards the left you didn't exactly enter into their lane but you're just you're so close you're sorry you're so close that the lorry driver the skip driver behind he he was having to slow down for you whereas the right hand side of the road was empty so you needed to just go in more and then go around you kind of started going around quite quickly which is why the left lane was being cut off do you remember hearing a hoot on that roundabout a little bit yeah and that's quite similar to a fault that we had a few lessons back remember when we had that big lorry behind us and you came off a dual carriageway in the right lane same thing you're just cause you're going round towards like a left bend let's say you're kind of just cutting it a bit too early okay so there is a bit of a,1469.12,1512.84,867,193,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=1469,"9 - The situation is quite critical as the driver is not only cutting into the path of a large vehicle but also causing the driver to slow down, which could potentially lead to an accident if not corrected.","problem with your lane discipline when entering roundabouts. As you enter, you're cutting back towards the left, rather than staying in your lane. This causes problems for other drivers, such as the lorry driver behind you, who had to slow down because you were so close. The right-hand side of the road was empty, so it would have been better for you to go around and enter the roundabout more smoothly. When you did start going around, you did it too quickly, which caused the left lane to be cut off. Did you hear the hoot on that roundabout? It was similar to when we had a big lorry behind us a few lessons ago. We were on a dual carriageway, and when we came off in the right lane, you did the same thing by cutting it a bit too early. It's important to improve your lane discipline when entering roundabouts."
pattern there so i want to talk about road marking because it was two separate occasions with road markings you're not positioning properly the first one was quite a heavy minor fault which was your roundabout right turn so the roundabout was quite a sharp right and you kind of have to go over the roundabout but i felt like you went over it a lot more than you needed to remember that one there was like a prius in front of us at the time yeah yeah so you needed to try to come round to the left and then turn so the right side tires can go over but not the left you went all four it was really heavy because of the shape and because of the angle of the turn you couldn't exactly avoid going over the roundabout so that's why i was like yeah so it's mainly just that lorry issue that was that was really what got it for you besides that it was a good drive just a few minor things here and there but we'll talk about those now okay,1515.039,1563.12,933,199,bwrf27rJj7U,1609,https://youtu.be/bwrf27rJj7U?t=1515,"Critical situation level: 5 - The situation was moderately critical as the learner driver made a heavy minor fault while turning right on a roundabout, going over it more than necessary, but there was also a Prius in front of them.","Pattern there, so I want to talk about road markings, because it was two separate occasions with road markings where you're not positioning properly.

But, I felt like you went over it a lot more than you needed to. Remember that there was like a Prius in front of us at the time? Yeah, yeah. So, you needed to try to come round to the left and then turn so the right side tires can go over, but not the left. You went all four, it was really heavy because of the shape and because of the angle of the turn. You couldn't exactly avoid going over the roundabout, so that's why I was like, ""Yeah.""

just a bit sudden so you've got to be a bit more careful with pedestrians there the other one was your reversing on the right now this one i feel like it was a bit it wasn't that bad yeah but it could have been yeah been good because what happened there is it wasn't that bad because you're reversing very nicely you're keeping it straight and then all of a sudden and i just i'm moving it's like steering and you started steering left and you're kind of looking and you're steering you kept going and i thought oh you did realize you did countersteer but we're already too far out now did you realize how much space you had so yeah you should just kept it straight what made you turn i thought i was going yeah i thought i was going too far we were actually okay the whole time you were you had a like a decent gap you probably had about a dream with don't you don't want to go any wider than yeah okay and then if you're,1541.76,1591.6,922,199,4MJAwfZF92k,1812,https://youtu.be/4MJAwfZF92k?t=1541,"Critical level: 4.

Before we get started, we want to make sure that youâre comfortable with the vehicle. You want to adjust your mirrors, adjust your seat, make sure everything is good. Now, before we start driving, we want to perform a safety check. Weâre going to check our lights, weâre going to check our signals, weâre going to check our brakes, and weâre going to check our horn. Now, before we start driving, Iâm going to show you a hand-over-hand turn. So, we want to put our signal on, we want to check our mirrors, we want to check our blind spots, and then we want to turn our vehicle smoothly. When weâre driving, we want to make sure that weâre looking far ahead, weâre always aware of our surroundings, weâre checking our mirrors, and weâre staying in our lane. Now, when we come up to a stop sign, we want to make sure that we come to a complete stop, weâre aware of our surroundings, and then we proceed. Same thing with a red light, we want to come to a complete stop, weâre aware of our surroundings, and then we proceed. Okay, now weâre going to do a lane change. We want to put our signal on, we want to check our mirrors, we want to check our blind spots, and then we proceed smoothly into the next lane. Now, when weâre parallel parking, we want to make sure that weâre aware of our surroundings, weâre checking our mirrors, weâre checking our blind spots, and then weâre smoothly turning into our parking spot.

Today we're gonna be doing some real-life driving, and we're gonna see how it goes.

So first things first, we're gonna be starting on this street right here. We're gonna be taking a left turn, and then we're gonna be making our way down to the stop sign.

Now when we get to the stop sign, we're gonna make a complete stop. We're not gonna do a rolling stop, we're gonna do a complete stop. And we're gonna make sure there are no cars or pedestrians coming before we go.

We're gonna go through the stop sign, we're gonna make a right turn, and then we're gonna come up to this curve right here.

Now this curve is a bit tricky, so we wanna make sure that we slow down before we get to it. We don't wanna be going too fast or we might lose control of the vehicle.

Once we get around that curve, we're gonna come up to this intersection right here. Now this is a four-way stop, so we wanna make sure that we're paying attention to all the other cars and making sure that we're not gonna hit anybody.

We're gonna make a left turn at this intersection and then we're gonna come up to this hill right here. Now this hill is a bit steep, so we're gonna have to give it a little bit more gas than usual to make it up.

Once we get up to the top of the hill, we're gonna make a right turn and then we're gonna come up to this red light. We're gonna make a complete stop at the stop line, we're gonna make sure it's safe to go, and then we're gonna continue straight.

going on around you so i'm just going to go over the main point so firstly um you had a little bit of trouble with the gears the car switched off on that gradient didn't it yeah did you realize why it switched off because it kind of struggled to get going yeah did you realize it's because you were changing too early i wasn't adding enough gas yeah and plus with the gear change because you take a little bit too long actually clutching changing bringing it up that's what's causing the car to slow down so much so the car slows down quite quickly going uphill as soon as you step off the accelerator and then on top of that we're trying to go into a higher gear which doesn't have the same power as gear 1 did so that's why the car was really struggling and it turned off and we just stood there for a little while steering you know with that junction with that lorry was on the right of you he was giving you way yeah he's looking,1325.44,1372.0,933,197,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=1325,"Critical level: 6 - The driving situation is moderately critical as the car had trouble going uphill and turned off, but there was no immediate danger present. The situation could have escalated if proper gear changes were not made.","Going on around you, so I'm just going to go over the main points. Firstly, you had a little bit of trouble with the gears. The car switched off on that gradient, didn't it? Yeah. Did you realize why it switched off? Because it struggled to get going? Yeah. Did you realize it's because you were changing too early and weren't adding enough gas? Plus, with the gear change, you take a little bit too long actually clutching, changing, and bringing it up. That's what's causing the car to slow down so much. The car slows down quite quickly going uphill as soon as you step off the accelerator. On top of that, we're trying to go into a higher gear, which doesn't have the same power as gear 1. That's why the car was really struggling and it turned off. We just stood there for a little while. Steering, you know, with that junction with that lorry on the right of you, he was giving you way. Yeah, he's looking."
at you isn't he so you know he's giving you way but you should have thought about the way we're coming out you just did the whole thing even the front tire hit the pavement not even the back so we needed to come out the junction didn't we you kind of just turned on the spot so that was a big issue there um moving off safety now this is something you are checking you're looking all around but then let's say there's two or three cars and you're waiting for that car and you know okay i can go after that one or you know you check both these two mirrors but you don't check your blind spot again and that happened a few times and the points that was happening it was quite main so you need to recheck that blind spot over your shoulder is that something that's been brought to your attention before yeah yeah then we had use of mirrors change direction which was just over here so when we turned off of that dual,1374.08,1420.799,913,192,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=1374,"carriageway onto the side road, the driving situation was around a 6 because there was potential danger in not properly assessing the turning and coming out of the junction.",carriageway you didn't check your left mirror and then we had to stop because there was a car coming up on the left hand side and then straightaway you went to do your left signal but I had to say hold on a minute because there was actually no road there so you need to check use your left mirror before any change of direction and then make sure it's safe to do so before then doing any signal  so learning point from today just get the car moving a little bit more progressive look further ahead in the junctions but overall still quite a good drive we just need to sharpen up on those areas okay
carriageway and we turned left the road was really wide you went into the overtaking lane which is fine we should have stayed in the left lane anyways but once you were in the overtaking lane you decided to move left with no mirrors no signal there was a car behind but they weren't very close i didn't have to take control but you just you're not letting anybody know what you're about to do and you're not really checking okay and then lastly lane discipline you know when we were driving on that forty road yeah you realize you got hooted right why was that because i was hogging the lane i was like yeah you were kind of over that white line and even later after that we had a bit of a jolt even later you kept looking down that's the issue like i kept thinking like am i in the right gear like should i move up so you so you were never in the wrong gear like you were just changing gears a bit too early but you were never in the wrong gear,1422.24,1472.08,945,205,7DgY6I8nVH4,1633,https://youtu.be/7DgY6I8nVH4?t=1422,"Driving situation: 7 

The situation is critical because the driver exhibits poor lane discipline, lacks proper signaling, and checks while changing lanes, which can lead to accidents. Additionally, the driver's distracted behavior leads to a lack of attention to the road, making it even more crucial.","Carriageway, and we turned left. The road was really wide. You went into the overtaking lane, which is fine. We should have stayed in the left lane anyway, but once you were in the overtaking lane, you decided to move left with no mirrors, no signal.

Okay, and then lastly, lane discipline. You know when we were driving on that 40 road, yeah? You realize you got hooted, right? Why was that? Because I was hogging the lane. I was like, ""Yeah."" You were kind of over that white line, and even later after that, we had a bit of a jolt. Even later, you kept looking down. That's the issue. Like, I kept thinking, ""Am I in the right gear?

Next, let's take a look at your mirrors. Check your rearview mirror first, and then your side mirrors. Adjust them so that you can see everything you need to see. Remember, you need to be aware of everything that's happening around you when you're driving.

Okay, now we're ready to start the actual driving portion of the test. Make sure you adjust your seat and your steering wheel so that you're comfortable and in control of the car. Put on your seatbelt, and let's get started.

The first thing you're going to do is pull out of the parking lot, and then we'll start down the road. Remember to use your turn signals when appropriate, and to keep an eye on your speed. You don't want to go too fast or too slow.

As we're driving, I'll give you some instructions, such as which way to turn or when to brake. Just remember to stay calm and focused, and to follow my instructions to the best of your ability.

Okay, we're almost done with the test. Just a few more maneuvers to go, and then we'll be back at the DMV. You're doing great so far, just keep it up!"

And now we're just cruising down the street again, staying within the speed limit. And we're going to come up to another stop sign soon. So, I'm going to slow down a little bit. And now we're here at the stop sign. So, I'm going to come to a complete stop, look both ways, and then we're going to continue driving. Okay, everything's going pretty smoothly so far. I'm just trying to make sure that I'm staying aware of my surroundings and following all of the rules of the road. And now we're going to come up to a roundabout. So, I'm going to use my turn signal and we're going to enter the roundabout. Okay, this is a little bit nerve-wracking because I haven't had much experience with roundabouts, but I think we're doing okay. And now we're going to exit the roundabout. So, I'm going to use my turn signal again and we're going to turn right. Okay, I'm feeling pretty good so far. I think we're doing okay. And now we're just on a straightaway road, so I'm just trying to make sure that I'm staying within the speed limit and staying focused on the road ahead. And we're coming up to a pedestrian crossing, so I'm going to slow down and make sure that there's no pedestrians crossing the road. And it looks like we're good, so we're going to continue driving. And we're coming up to another traffic light, and this one's currently yellow, so I'm going to stop because I don't want to run a red light. And it looks like it's going to turn green soon, so we're just going to wait here for a minute. And now it's green, so we're going to continue driving. Okay, we're almost done with the test now, I think. I'm just trying to stay focused and make sure that I'm not making any mistakes. And we're coming up to another stop sign, so I'm going to slow down a little bit. And here we are at the stop sign, so I'm going to come to a complete stop, look both ways, and then we're going to continue driving. Okay, and now we're coming up to the DMV, so I just have to pull into the parking lot and park the car, and then we'll see what the instructor says. Okay, I think I did pretty well. I'm feeling pretty confident. So, thank you guys so much for watching this video. I hope you enjoyed seeing me take my driving test, and I'll see you all in my next video. Bye!"

The car park's pretty empty, just come over all the way left and then just drive into it that way. You won't have to reverse, would you? Because you started right, it was really tricky to get that straight angle parking. Okay, so I've given you a steering and serious.

you're kind of carrying most of your speed i looked at the speed it was still 21 when you were right next to the pavement and you were trying to get it even closer and you you've not got your clutch down and you're not actually slow so as soon as you know you're parking mirror signal start slowing down brake clutch and keep rolling but at a much slower speed i only reached the wheel because it was getting too close for the speed that you're traveling okay and i don't want to take the risk of cutting the tire like that because if you touch the pavement at low speeds you're not going to do much damage but at high speeds yeah what's going to happen yeah you're going to cut your tire there was one you know what there was one right near the beginning which nearly gave you a serious fault so we came up to the first roundabout it was quite a small roundabout and i said go ahead the roundabout has that blue arrow,1896.08,1941.039,918,193,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=1896,"Critical situation: 8 - The situation is critical because the learner driver is carrying too much speed and is not using their clutch, which could result in a potential tire-cutting hazard.

I looked at the speed; it was still 21 when you were right next to the pavement, and you were trying to get it even closer. And you've not got your clutch down, and you're not actually slow.

I only reached the wheel because it was getting too close for the speed that you're traveling. Okay, and I don't want to take the risk of cutting the tire like that because if you touch the pavement at low speeds, you're not going to do much damage, but at high speeds, what's going to happen? Yeah, you're going to cut your tire.

There was one, you know what? There was one right near the beginning, which nearly gave you a serious fault. So, we came up to the first roundabout it was quite a small roundabout, and I said go ahead, the roundabout has that blue arrow."
and as you've gone forward you've indicated left you've gone past the first exit and then indicated left again had somebody been on that first round about that would have given you a serious fault straight away do you know which one i mean yeah i think so yeah um then you know when we were driving on the a40 it was 40 miles per hour you joined the slippers really nicely but then you were driving quite slow you were driving 25 when it's 40 and i know the traffic wasn't at 40 which is what saved you a little bit but there's still points where we could have sped up a little bit more yeah did you realize you were slow on that road yeah you did speed up a little bit more later but it just just took a bit too long and now i know you mentioned the gears but let's talk about when you're gearing down because when we were in fourth gear approaching that roundabout the car nearly cut off didn't it on that,1943.44,1990.399,907,196,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=1943,"section of the driving lesson video, the situation is moderately critical with a rating of 5. The mistake of not yielding at the first roundabout could have resulted in a serious fault, and the slow driving on the A40 could have been dangerous, but the traffic at the time saved the situation. The near stall while gearing down approaching the roundabout could have also been problematic, but it did not cause any serious danger.","And as you've gone forward, you've indicated left. You've gone past the first exit and then indicated left again. Had somebody been on that first roundabout, that would have given you a serious fault straight away. Do you know which one I mean?

Yeah, I think so.

Yeah. Um, then you know when we were driving on the A40, it was 40 miles per hour. You joined the slip road really nicely, but then you were driving quite slow. You were driving 25 when it's 40. And I know the traffic wasn't at 40, which is what saved you a little bit. But there's still points where we could have sped up a little bit more. Did you realize you were slow on that road?

Yeah.

You did speed up a little bit more later, but it just took a bit too long. And now I know you mentioned the gears, but let's talk about when you're gearing down. Because when we were in fourth gear approaching that roundabout, the car nearly cut off, didn't it? On that..."
gradient yeah it did yeah that's what you want about the the gear thing right yeah yeah make sure when you're slowing down that you're knocking the gears down as well it'll put the clutch in a bit early because you're too slow for the gear that you're in okay and even here we turned off the engine before coming in yeah you're traveling in third gear what's the minimum that third gear will do um 30 minimum 25 minutes third okay 15 15. yeah okay so if you're driving because the thing is when you but that's not the speed that you change into third so when you're driving in second you speed up to above 20 and you go third right so driving in third 20 plus if you're slowing down from 30 let's say you can slow down as far as 15 and then put the clutch down if you wanted to we don't always get it to that number but you can what you're doing is you're bringing it,1992.0,2044.96,867,198,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=1992,Criticality: 3 - The situation is not very critical as it is mainly a discussion of gear shifting and slowing down while driving.,"Gradient, yeah, it did. Yeah, that's what you want about the gear thing, right? Yeah, yeah. Make sure when you're slowing down that you're knocking the gears down as well. It'll put the clutch in a bit early because you're too slow for the gear that you're in. Okay, and even here we turned off the engine before coming in. Yeah, you're traveling in third gear. What's the minimum that third gear will do? Um, 30 minimum, 25 minutes in third. Okay, 15. 15. Yeah, okay. So if you're driving, because the thing is when you--but that's not the speed that you change into third, so when you're driving in second you speed up to above 20 and you go third, right? So driving in third, 20 plus. If you're slowing down from 30, let's say, you can slow down as far as 15, and then put the clutch down if you wanted to. We don't always get it to that number, but you can. What you're doing is you're bringing it--."
well below that number that's when the car is struggling so when you were in fourth gear your speed was coming down below 20 miles per hour that the car was about to switch off it was actually at 16. so i looked at the speed at the time and same here we were down to about 12 10. that's why the car turned off afterwards because the the gear just can't cope with that speed and that's the same thing that happened when we got into that car park do you remember when you when you turned into the car park and then you said oh what am i what am i doing i was concerned about the gear because you were in second and the car was nearly cutting off stop stopping yeah so you've got to realize when you're traveling too slow for the gear what sort of warning does the car give you vibrate okay yeah john is a little bit but that's quite late that warning okay so as soon as your speed is coming down you should be thinking wait should i,2046.48,2091.599,930,202,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=2046,"Rate: 8 - The driving situation is critical because the speed is dropping significantly below the minimum required for the gear, leading to the danger of stalling or switching off the car. The warning signs provided by the car are also limited and may come too late.","change gear to a lower one to maintain my speed and if you do that you'll find that the car will run much smoother and you won't have that issue of the car potentially cutting off or struggling. So just remember to always be aware of your speed and what gear you're in especially when you're going up hills or down hills or making turns or going into a car park. You need to be aware of what gear you're in and what speed you're doing and that way you'll avoid any potential issues with the car. Alright, so let's continue driving and we'll talk a little bit more about gear changing as we go along."
change gear yeah you'll feel it um there is a lot of good things about your drive like you on those roundabouts you were checking your mirrors even when you knew you were in the wrong lane you're checking you're not just kind of moving over which is great but now you need to make sure when you're checking that you're not just cutting people off because you're looking at that lady you know she's right there but you've still moved in front of her she happened to adjust for us but not everyone will know that you're trying to move over okay so it's more of a safety thing on that one yeah generally you know whenever the road went into two lanes and two lanes and both of those lanes were going straight you you happen to kind of keep getting into the right one and then people around us who now want to overtake are going on the left overtake which then puts you in danger so you should make sure if the road opens into two and they're both going,2093.44,2141.52,949,198,0L7SDvnWU2k,2218,https://youtu.be/0L7SDvnWU2k?t=2093,7- The driving situation is quite critical as the learner driver needs to be aware of the safety concerns of cutting someone off while checking her mirrors and also needs to be mindful of not putting herself in danger while driving in multiple lanes.,"straight, choose the left lane unless you need to turn right. Also, when changing gear, you will feel it, so be aware of that. Another good thing about your driving is that you check your mirrors, even when you're in the wrong lane. However, don't just move over without making sure you're not cutting anyone off. You need to be careful and make sure you're not putting anyone in danger. When the road goes into two lanes and both are going straight, choose the left one unless you need to turn right. People around you may try to overtake on the left, which could put you in danger.

Explanation: The situation is not critical at all as the student is simply parking in a car park and following the arrows while making sure to park within the lines.",stop on the line as long as you're not over it but ideally we want to be within the lines so we're not taking up space for other cars now let's reverse out and we're gonna do reverse parking so once i'm clear i'm gonna indicate to the left and check my mirrors checking both mirrors and i'm reversing slowly keeping within the lines checking all around now i can see the parking space i want and i'm gonna start turning in checking my rear view mirror making sure i don't hit anything and i'm gonna use my reference point once we're in turn the wheel back and we're parked in between the lines perfect all right and that's it for the parking portion of the test well done.
be on the line but do you know what oh my god let's reverse that whenever you're ready oh you want me to fix it oh no i'm good we're happy to leave it there okay cool see toy okay off we go loads of observation in the car park because people do weird things in car parks it looks clear one second and then the next second someone's got out of their car and they're walking behind you so out of the car park and a left turn come on g super clear oh your car's so nice the suspension's so good if you can pull over and park up on the left no problem just up here uh on a yellow line okay cool if you're not sure just ask your examiner so this would be considered pulling over somewhere safe okay cancel handbrake with the next instruction all right francis drive off one of you ready all right cool the examiner is going to pull you over like that a few times i'm on the hill so i'm,1092.4,1168.24,880,195,SsPcN6Ho-ZE,1550,https://youtu.be/SsPcN6Ho-ZE?t=1092,"Critical level 2 - The situation is not very critical as they are in a car park and going for a left turn, but the instructor mentions the importance of observation as people do weird things in car parks.","on the lookout for the traffic i'm gonna release the handbrake but i'm gonna keep my foot on the brake pedal until i've checked everything's clear all right let's go it's gonna be a right turn coming up so do remember correct lane position all right cool so this roundabout we're gonna go straight ahead third exit exit off and towards that red car it's gonna be a left turn off this junction oh look there's a bike let's just hold back and give him some space very important that you give motorcyclists plenty of space on the road alright second roundabout straight ahead also third exit as well so i'm gonna be indicating left, give way to the left, mirror and signal all clear so let's pull out okay i'm gonna be keeping my distance just in case anything changes all right approach the next roundabout straight ahead and then it's gonna be the second exit past the petrol station don't forget that mirror whenever there's something around you okay super keep following this road it's gonna be a left turn along with the road and into what's called the bus lane it's got a painted T on it so left turn along with the road into the bus lane it's just there okay cancel the signal so end of the bus lane turn left so the next exit on this small roundabout it's a little bit tight now so you'll have to slow down a bit look and check for visibility it's all clear because there's this parked car getting in the way now we're gonna go into the car park just to do the reverse maneuver all right this car park's got one of those tricky little left-hand turns so as we go around the corner i'm gonna steer the wheel to the left all right so alignment to the left one steer's enough straighten it up and then we're gonna look behind us through that corner so this is gonna be a reverse bay park so we're gonna find the box and then stop with the signal towards the box all right good so we're in line with the box nicely we pack closely but we don't touch it so one steer to the right ready and when it's safe to do so we're just gonna reverse back staying reasonably close to the white lines the right side is fairly tight so you'll need to keep an eye on that and when the car is straight with the other side it's time to steer one turn to the left and then straighten up again and then check ahead and move forward into the bay alright so that's it for the driving part of the test and we will see if you passed or failed for the driving bit."

you're looking left so you're not looking left before yeah okay so i need to look before yeah and during them that's it so what happened there is initially you just got a miner for not looking around and then when you reversed out right at the end yeah there was a dangerous fault yeah yeah there was that black learner car coming yeah and that's what it went up into a serious fault so they're coming round and you're reversing and halfway through reversing you've looked yeah and they already haven't seen yeah i'm too close yeah okay so that's that's that maneuver there besides that um a few things i know the gears might be the the car there because you kind of went into three installed four installs you've just got to keep it to the left um there's moving off safety this happened quite early on so when you moved off on the first two stops you didn't really check your blind spot at all yeah you did later on yeah but the,1719.6,1763.36,930,191,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=1719,criticality of the driving situation is a 9/10 because there was a dangerous fault with a potential collision with another vehicle.,initial times you didn't check it yeah and then on the roundabout there's a few issues with lanes and positioning yeah so as you're coming up to the roundabout i just want you to be a bit more conscious of what lane you need to be in yeah and be it yeah commit to it early so then when you're on the roundabout you're in the correct lane yeah and then that's going to help you deal with the next exit as well okay um so that's the main stuff that i would say yeah so unfortunately you've picked up two serious faults and one minor fault which means that's a driving test fail okay so um i'm just going to give you some feedback now okay so first of all i think it would just really help you to just take a bit more time to analyze your surroundings okay so what other cars are ahead of you behind you to the side of you okay where the road markings are okay and what turns are coming up so you can anticipate what's happening next okay um also just to be a bit more confident as well so be a bit more positive with what you're doing okay if you feel like you're safe to move and there's no cars around signal and go rather than being hesitant and then causing other drivers confusion yeah okay um but yep all the best for next time just take you those bits of feedback and work on it from there okay all the best thank you
first two you didn't check at all okay um you're very hesitant on roundabouts now that went into that nearly went into a serious fault okay so did you realize you were being a bit closer i was yeah i think because i do my other tests i've been sort of tried to go sometimes too early and then causes me to get a major okay so like i'm trying to be like i don't want to go too soon but i don't obviously hold up traffic too so so the times that you have been hesitant it was on on one of them it was at the very beginning so you're probably a little bit nervous so when we get to the first round about it kind of looks like a t-junction yeah there was nobody to your right but there's vehicles to your left yeah you got there and you're just looking left and they're waiting for you and you're waiting for there yeah so that's why it went into okay well why are we waiting yeah and then later on we,1765.84,1810.48,897,199,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=1765,would rate this situation a 7 because the learner driver's hesitation on roundabouts almost caused a serious fault.,got to a roundabout and you were a bit hesitant there as well so for roundabouts you just need to be a bit more confident and just assess the situation so check mirrors check right see if anything's coming from the right if there is then just slow down a little bit and then just assess the situation and then just go and be confident okay and then the reverse we just need to do a bit more practice on that okay so you just need to make sure that you're turning the wheel the right way okay and then just be a bit more confident on that as well okay so we'll just do a bit more practice and then we'll book another test okay so how do you think it went today overall?
had um a vehicle on the right yeah yes we give way to them but then there's a bus in front yeah and that bus what do they do yeah they they come forward and they completely blocked the car didn't they yeah and you just carried on waiting and i thought oh that was a really big gap yeah yeah so we got to make sure we take these opportunities to get going you are really confident with driving with with your pedals the gears and stuff you do change gears quite quickly which is great so it's just kind of little things that i need like probably my nerves i just need to get more confident with yeah you just need to keep practicing like you said you've had an issue with observation yeah so you're being a little bit cautious yeah but now you're being overly cautious so you want to find that middle ground with that one okay how many miners did i actually get in total miners i've got a few advisories in there so you've got one two three four five six seven eight nine ten,1813.12,1858.159,974,201,E_7cUyMqve8,1899,https://youtu.be/E_7cUyMqve8?t=1813,"4 - The situation is somewhat critical as there was a bus blocking the way, but it was not overly dangerous.","Had a vehicle on the right, yeah.

Um, so let's start right from the beginning. As you were driving, we got to that first roundabout. You stalled, right? Yeah, why did we stall? I was in third gear, yeah, and I didn't say anything. And it was just a minor at first. You just thought, ""Okay, whatever."" Then you tried to move again in the same gear, and I was like, ""Oh, shoot, don't do it, don't do it."" You even restarted the car quite quickly. You didn't need to press the button, you just needed to put the clutch down. It would have restarted. And then you tried again, and now everyone's frustrated. It's like, ""Oh no,"" and I thought, ""Come on, change the gear."" And then you were trying again, the third time, and that's when I said, ""No, no, it's not going to work."" And this is why. Yeah, you should have realized straight away that the pickup, why is it not there? Yeah, so I think, maybe nerves at the beginning, yeah, and I didn't try the car before."
yeah no of course but yeah if there's an issue with the gear check it you kind of tried three three times and that's when i was but not happening um overall really good drive but the issues that have happened kind of like oh so like i said there really wasn't many miners that was just serious serious so the first one was gears of course and as we're going further um after the high street the high street was really good you're really dealing with everything anticipating well the satnav's telling you to go right and what was on your right hello no entry no entry and i thought oh he's not going to do it he's not going to do it and then you really tried and that's when i said not here over there i've always heard about that anointing so yeah even if you realized a bit late it would have been fine but you actually tried to turn in so that was really silly um then the parallel park what happened i don't know before coming to this uh,1441.12,1499.679,940,199,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=1441,I cannot provide an answer as the given text does not provide enough context to determine the criticality of the driving situation.,"Yeah, no of course, but yeah, if there's an issue with the gear, check it.

Overall, really good drive, but the issues that have happened kind of like, oh, so like I said, there really wasn't many minors, that was just serious, serious. So, the first one was gears, of course, and as we're going further, um, after the high street, the high street was really good. You're really dealing with everything, anticipating well. The satnav's telling you to go right, and what was on your right? Hello, no entry, no entry, and I thought, oh, he's not going to do it, he's not going to do it, and then you really tried, and that's when I said, ""Not here, over there.""

The driver had difficulty following instructions and was not aware of the required distance for parking.,"Test, yeah, I did a maneuver perfectly, I don't know what happened. So with the parallel park, you tried the first time and you were just trying to park too close with the car, and the back tire did climb up on the first time, so it wasn't really great. You know, we were going too close, but then you tried again. You went right back into the road, and then the second time you started even earlier, where I was like, ""Shoot, we're gonna hit this car!"" And then you got so close where I had to just tell you to stop. Yeah, yeah, but did you realize how close you got? Okay, so with that maneuver, did you realize at the beginning, I said, ""Park within two car lengths?"" Now, what does that mean? So, I get two car spaces, basically.

so there's a few other things i know it's different but um you were just trying to park in a really tight spot so what i would do is if this is kind of parallel how you started what you were doing was this and i'm just like why are we parking so close just do this just give yourself that space why do you need to you know and everyone was waiting yeah no that was okay you know whatever as we got into the road everyone turned up that wasn't even my concern because you were looking around and you know they got on with it but it was the pavement that's we're turning too sharply okay i think there was one more that's ever crossing so what happened on that zebra crossing was there was a vehicle that was parked on the pavement on the zigzag lines now nobody should park there right but the fact that the parked car is there yeah i didn't see it we can't see the left side so you should have come into that a bit,1553.84,1601.84,914,196,r5d_KSnrpmA,1705,https://youtu.be/r5d_KSnrpmA?t=1553,"Critical level: 7 - The situation of parking in a tight spot with people waiting was not critical, but the sharp turn on the zebra crossing with a parked car on the zigzag lines is a higher risk situation.","So there's a few other things.

Why do you need to, you know?"" And everyone was waiting. Yeah, no, that was okay, you know, whatever. As we got into the road, everyone turned up. That wasn't even my concern because you were looking around, and, you know, they got on with it, but it was the pavement that's we're turning too sharply. Okay, I think there was one more. That's ever crossing. So what happened on that zebra crossing was there was a vehicle that was parked on the pavement on the zigzag lines. Now, nobody should park there, right?

He continues to look over his right blind spot and over towards his left to make sure that nobody is close to his vehicle while reversing. He is using braking and clutch together, which does make it harder to control the speed of the vehicle. When using clutch control, lift the clutch up to move a little bit faster, and dip the clutch down to slow the vehicle down. The only time you need the foot brake is if you're on a gradient or if putting the clutch down doesn't slow you down enough. So then you put the clutch down fully and use the brake to control the speed. Josh does decide to go forward to readjust his maneuver. This will give you a minor fault for control with your reverse parking. He does look all around, making sure that no one is on his right blind spot before going forward.

So, if you're there and you're kind of just staying there and you're a hazard being there, yeah, everyone's gonna move. And then the second time that issue happened was just back there. You know those traffic lights where we were turning right? We're turning right and there are two lanes for turning right. You happen to get into the overtaking one, didn't you? It was a straight and right lane, right? And at the traffic lights, we were going right. There were two lanes going right. You were in the second one. Was it two right-only lanes? Yes, I think I only saw the first one. Yeah, no."
that's okay but then as we moved off there was a van on your left and he went round us and he went in the left lane as you're moving off you're checking your mirror and you're moving into the left lane and there was a prius black one you should have just stayed on the right so whatever lane you're in just turn in that one and just kind of make progress and then come back yeah so it wasn't an issue the fact that you're even in that lane it's the issue is you're changing and they're not expecting you to change at this point okay so you are checking your mirrors a lot of the times you are checking but you're you're kind of not acting on what you actually see yeah okay um then we had that pedestrian crossing quite early you know that zebra crossing yeah there were two pedestrians the first one caught you off by guard a little bit but then as you're waiting i think the windscreen pillar definitely was a blind spot wasn't it with that second man,1807.6,1854.64,953,204,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=1807,"Critical level: 5.

He went round us and went in the left lane. As you're moving off, you're checking your mirrors and moving into the left lane. And there was a Prius, a black one. You should have just stayed on the right. So, whatever lane you're in, just turn in that one and make progress, then come back. Yeah, so it wasn't an issue, the fact that you're even in that lane. The issue is you're changing, and they're not expecting you to change at this point. Okay, you are checking your mirrors a lot of the times. You are checking, but you're not acting on what you see.

But then as you're waiting, I think the windscreen pillar definitely was a blind spot, wasn't it, with that second man?"
yeah yeah because he was already in the road and i had to say stop even though you would have seen him you know had he stepped in a bit more but you would have moved by that point um so yeah when you're at zebra crossing yes and these pillars you can easily see behind them by just kind of yeah moving your head so that caught you off there um junction observation so this is that big roundabout where we were going straight and you managed to get into the middle lane and there was a bit of a queue in the middle lane but left and right were empty it was a 40 road again but we were following heathrow yeah and now as you kind of entered that round about the gap that you took with that silver bmw i think it was was was quite quite a risky gap he kind of he was stepping on it so the guy next to you you kind of both moved off together but the car next to you he,1855.76,1899.76,864,189,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=1855,"Critical level: 7

The situation is quite critical as the learner driver took a risky gap while entering the roundabout, and had to move off with cars on both sides. It could have led to a potential collision.",was signaling quite early to go into the right lane so he was always going to move over and then you ended up kind of cutting in front of him so just be aware of other drivers' intentions and signaling but yeah just generally try and take a safer gap um and then obviously on the approach to that roundabout just making sure you're in the correct lane so that you're not having to kind of move across lanes and taking a risky gap. And then just at the end there the reverse parking you did um you know you did quite well with that it was just a couple of observations that you could have done so just remember to always check your blind spot before reversing and then obviously using your mirrors as well and then just when you're driving throughout just making sure that you're checking your mirrors regularly and taking note of other road users and their intentions.
went a lot quicker than you did and it's one of those roads where if you can go in just you know be on your way go yeah was that the big that grey van truck kind of no this was so we did that round about twice so the first attempt we did that round about from the dual carriageway and we were going straight and you were in the middle lane yeah and you went straight from the middle lane so the path you took was great it's just the gap that you've taken to enter was risky so it wasn't it wasn't a good gap um the second time we did the roundabout we were on the the side road crossing the dual carriageway where it probably seemed like you were waiting for too long i had to feel like these are not safe i'm like how yeah exactly so the fact that you kept waiting it was fine because you didn't actually miss any opportunities there okay and i know it can sometimes feel like oh maybe i should be going yeah because everyone,1901.76,1950.88,926,202,Lvcw9XeTl8I,2073,https://youtu.be/Lvcw9XeTl8I?t=1901,"Critical level: 8.

First, we'll check the seat and mirrors. Adjust the seat so you can easily reach the pedals and steering wheel. Check the mirrors - the rearview mirror should show the entire rear window and the side mirrors should show the edges of the car.

Next, we'll test your turn signals. Turn on the left turn signal and then the right. Make sure they're working properly.

Now, we'll check your brakes. Press down on the brake pedal and make sure it feels firm.

Finally, we'll test your headlights. Turn on the headlights and make sure they're working properly. That's it for the pre-test check.

Now, we'll begin the driving portion of the test. Remember to use your turn signals when turning or changing lanes. Keep both hands on the steering wheel and be aware of your surroundings.

Alright, let's start by backing out of this parking space. Remember to look behind you and use your mirrors.

Great job! Now, let's proceed out of the parking lot and onto the road. Remember to obey traffic signs and signals, and stay aware of pedestrians and other vehicles. You're doing great so far.

Alright, we're almost done with the test. Let's pull back into the parking space and turn off the car. Congratulations, you've passed the driving test!"

those cars when it was clear yeah you come out and what happened as you come out there's a car there on the opposite side as soon as that happened i i knew it yeah so as well as looking right you should have thought about how we're turning and how it's going to affect the left side because you went over it was quite wide yeah yeah you didn't actually need to turn on on on that particular junction like that but if you feel like you're going to do that if you're going to swing out then we need to wait for the left to also be clear okay okay the other serious fault is yours reverse parking observation you're kind of going into that space it's a little bit funny you are slightly out yeah and then you decided to fix it again and now there's been a very long time since you've looked over towards the right yeah and then when you started steering left what's happening to the front of your car,1387.28,1433.36,897,188,aKDXIcTkwLw,1633,https://youtu.be/aKDXIcTkwLw?t=1387,"Critical level 7 - The driving situation is critical because the learner driver failed to properly observe the traffic and plan ahead, resulting in a potential collision with a car on the opposite side of the road and poor reverse parking observation.","?

Although there is no immediate danger, turning into a new road requires proper attention and caution as there can be unexpected obstacles or other vehicles approaching.",", make sure to check your mirrors and signal to indicate your intention to turn. Always remember to give way to pedestrians and cyclists, and keep a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. As we approach the roundabout, slow down and look both ways to check for any oncoming traffic. If the way is clear, you may enter the roundabout and follow the road to the left. Remember to signal left before exiting the roundabout. Keep a steady speed and stay in the left-hand lane unless overtaking. If you need to change lanes, always check your mirrors and blind spots before indicating and moving across. Finally, when you reach your destination, safely park the car in a designated spot and switch off the engine. Congratulations, you have passed your driving test!"

First, we'll test your ability to parallel park. Find a space on the right-hand side of the road and let's get started."

The first thing you want to do is to make sure that you start the car. So, press on the brake pedal and turn the key in the ignition. Once the car has started, you want to make sure that your mirrors are adjusted correctly. So, check your rear view mirror, your side mirrors, and your side view mirror.

Next, you want to make sure that your seat is adjusted correctly. You want to make sure that you can reach the pedals comfortably, and that you can see clearly over the steering wheel. Remember to always wear your seat-belt.

Before you start driving, you want to make sure that it's safe to go. Check your blind spots by turning your head and looking over your shoulder. If it's safe, you can start driving.

Remember to always obey traffic laws and signals. Stop at stop signs and red lights, and make sure to use turn signals when you're changing lanes or turning.

Lastly, stay focused and aware of your surroundings. Keep a safe distance from other cars, and be prepared to react quickly if anything unexpected happens.

Good luck on your driving test![Music]"

Critical situation: 8 - While rare, brake failure is a serious situation that requires immediate action to avoid accidents and injuries.","So, before you start the engine, you need to sit properly in your seat, and adjust your mirrors with your headrests. Then, you need to fasten your seatbelt, and make sure that all the vehicle's doors are closed. After this, you can turn on the engine, and check the gauges to ensure that everything is working properly. When you are ready, depress the clutch pedal, and put the car in the first gear. Slowly release the clutch while at the same time pressing the accelerator pedal gently. When the car starts moving, you need to find the proper balance between the clutch and accelerator pedals while steering, and pay attention to the traffic around you. Remember that you need to signal correctly when turning or changing lanes, and stay within the speed limit while obeying all the road signs and markings.

Tyra's failure to check her mirrors and move into the outside lane while going around the roundabout and her confusion about the slip road and adding a new lane could cause issues, especially if someone enters the roundabout from exit number two at the same time.

So it's the anti-lock braking system. So when you stamp on the brake, you break really quite sharp. The brake pad comes into contact with the brake disc, and they lock up and you lose grip of the road surface, which is what happened.

Doing an emergency stop and the ABS going off is not an issue, but you're going to get a much more effective stop if it doesn't go off."""
so what you want to do with the break is you want to break firm progressive but firm oh yeah okay so let's talk about you know your habit of using the hold okay that's to so you every time you stop you kind of put the hold on which is fine because that's in your instructor's car but then you've put the hold on and you kind of lift the clutch up don't you but you're waiting at a red light with your clutch half up now why is that an issue why do you think that would be an issue okay well having the clutch up like that your clutch plates are ready to go so it's more wear and tear you're kind of burning them bringing them to that point but because the hold is on the car won't let you move off so the plates are ready and the car's ready but the traffic lights are just red so in terms of wear and tear on the clutch plates it's not good practice for you yeah to do that because it's going to burn up,1600.799,1655.2,904,202,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=1600,"Critical level: 4. 

While it's not an immediate danger to the driver, the wear and tear on the clutch plates is a concern that can cause future issues if not avoided.","So, what you want to do with the brake is you want to brake firm, progressive but firm. Oh yeah, okay. So, let's talk about your habit of using the hold. Okay, that's too. So, every time you stop, you kind of put the hold on, which is fine because that's in your instructor's car. But then you put the hold on and you kind of lift the clutch up, don't you? But you're waiting at a red light with your clutch half up. Now, why is that an issue? Why do you think that would be an issue? Okay, well, having the clutch up like that, your clutch plates are ready to go. So, it's more wear and tear. You're kind of burning them, bringing them to that point. But because the hold is on, the car won't let you move off. So, the plates are ready, and the car's ready, but the traffic lights are just red. So, in terms of wear and tear on the clutch plates, it's not good practice for you to do that because it's going to burn up."
the clutch plates over time um if you know you're waiting you might as well wait with the clutch down philly or even in in neutral some people like to wait like that yes cause i kind of learnt like that it's because they always say like okay get me get ready yeah so it's just for you generally like with my car i'm probably with your instructor's car as well when you bring the clutch up even a little bit the car starts to rev you can hear it can't you okay so you're waiting a red light in the car's revving so it's just wasting fuel especially with the economy right now do you really want to be doing that so wait with the clutch down brake on or hold on doesn't matter and then as soon as you want to go that's when you want to balance and get that position again it's just not something that the examiner is going to talk about this is more for you yeah because when you get in your own car afterwards you don't,1656.559,1698.48,918,199,s4J-nH3sG5k,1842,https://youtu.be/s4J-nH3sG5k?t=1656,"Critical level: 3 - The situation is not very critical, but it is important to save fuel by waiting with the clutch down or in neutral when waiting at a red light instead of revving the car.","want to be wasting fuel by waiting with the clutch up. It's also better for the clutch plates over time. If you're waiting at a red light, it's best to wait with the clutch down or even in neutral. Some people prefer to wait that way because instructors usually say ""get ready."" With my car, and probably with your instructor's car as well, the car starts to rev even if you bring the clutch up a little bit. You can hear it, right? So, waiting with the clutch up means you're wasting fuel, especially with the economy the way it is now. It's better to wait with the clutch down, brake on or hold on, it doesn't matter. When you want to go, that's when you want to balance and get the position again. The examiner won't talk about it; it's more for you. Because after you get your license and you drive your own car, you don't want to be wasting fuel by waiting with the clutch up."

You know, there is a little bit of a habit of mine, as long as it works, it doesn't matter. Yeah, so as long as you don't actually switch off in second gear, I was like, ""Oh, it's gonna go, it's gonna go.""

One was clearance, which was the very first driving fault. This was the very first road and there was a parked car on the left. There's a learner park opposite, it's quite a narrow little space and you've just kind of carried on. It felt quite close to the parked car on the left. Okay, so if you know it's a tighter space, #slower. Yeah, so that was the very first fault, clearance. And the second fault which came after we did the maneuver, we're driving down this road, Stains Road. Was it 30? I knew it was a 30.

It was all right, but I think there may have been one or two things.

Okay, what's that?

Um, the bay parking was one, and also, when we just came off that heading exit, um, there was a car that pulled right across, because I didn't see it, and then you came in, yeah, you really cut it fine on that one.

We're going to be taking a look at how to parallel park. This is a common maneuver that you'll need to be able to do in order to pass your driving test. So first things first, we need to find a space that's big enough for our car. So we're going to be looking for a space that's around two and a half times the length of our car. Once we've found a suitable space, we're going to need to position ourselves next to it. So make sure you're about half a meter away from the car in front and parallel to it. Then we're going to need to reverse back slowly while turning the steering wheel all the way to the right. Keep reversing until the back of your car is about 30 centimeters away from the curb. Then turn the steering wheel all the way to the left and reverse again until your car is in the middle of the space. Finally, straighten out your steering wheel and finish by adjusting your position if necessary. And that's how you parallel park. Remember to take it slowly and practice in a safe and empty parking lot until you feel confident enough to do it on the road."""

As we went forward from this point, the bus driver in front switched on their right signal to move away. Millie didn't realize this. She started overtaking with a right signal. She did realize very quickly and started giving way. So this did not go down as a serious fault, but always make sure to check the bus stop and see if the bus is about to move off. [Music] Millie does deal with the situation really well by checking her mirrors and getting back into position. If you're driving up behind a bus at high speeds and you start positioning and signaling to overtake, even if the bus driver changes their signal, sometimes it's safer to continue.

When you're first starting out with driving, it can seem a little bit intimidating, but it doesn't have to be. If you follow these tips, you'll be well on your way to becoming a safe and responsible driver.

Tip number one, get to know your vehicle. Before you even start the car, adjust your seat and mirrors, and ensure you're familiar with the controls, especially the brakes and accelerator.

Tip number two, adjust your seat and steering wheel position. You should be able to see the road clearly and reach all the controls easily.

Tip number three, buckle up. Make sure you and all your passengers buckle up before you start driving. It's the law and it could save your life.

Tip number four, use turn signals. Always use your turn signals when changing lanes or turning, even if you don't see any other vehicles around.

Tip number five, keep a safe distance. Maintain a safe following distance from other cars in front of you, especially in wet or icy conditions.

Tip number six, obey speed limit signs. Speed limits are there for a reason, to keep you safe. Obey them at all times.

Tip number seven, avoid distractions. Don't text, eat, or do anything else that could take your eyes off the road.

Tip number eight, stay focused. Always pay attention to your surroundings, including other cars, pedestrians, and road signs.

Tip number nine, practice defensive driving. Anticipate what other drivers might do and be prepared to react if necessary.

Tip number ten, be patient. Don't get agitated or frustrated if other drivers are slow or make mistakes. Stay calm and maintain your focus.

Tip number eleven, learn how to park. Practice different types of parking, parallel, angle, etc.

Tip number twelve, practice, practice, practice. The more you drive, the more comfortable and confident you'll become. So don't be afraid to get out there and practice."

So we're with *inaudible* today for her driving test. We just arrived at the test center. And I always find this part of the driving test is the most difficult, just waiting. Waiting for the examiners, you know, to come out of the test center and call you over. And it's the most nerve-wracking part of the test. But I always say to learners, you know, try and stay calm, relax, take some deep breaths, and just remember that, you know, you should be well-prepared for this test. You've had plenty of lessons. And just trust in your own ability.

So *inaudible* how are you feeling? You feeling nervous?

Yeah, I'm feeling a bit nervous.

Yeah, I can see that. Don't worry though, you know, the examiner's just another person. They're not there to trick you or catch you out. They just want to see that you're a safe driver. And if you make a mistake, it's not the end of the world. Just keep going and try not to let it affect the rest of your test.

Okay, it looks like the examiner's coming now. So I'm gonna wish *inaudible* good luck, and I'll catch up with her afterwards to see how she got on. Good luck, *inaudible*!"

He's booked it on in November, but he'd like to bring his test forward. So today's mock test is just to gauge where he's at and if there are any concerns, if I can give him any feedback.

As we're getting to the end of the slip road, the traffic on the main road is quite busy and they're not exactly up to 40 miles per hour either, so the progress wasn't an issue. As we're going to the end, Luke needed to adjust his speed either by going a bit faster or by going a bit slower. There was a vehicle to the right, but he dealt with it safely, so this didn't go down as a fault. (Music) As it's 40 miles per hour, even if you've missed the first speed sign, you will see signs throughout the road as a reminder. The signs are on the lamppost on the left-hand side of the road and sometimes on the right. Luke misses quite a few before he realizes the speed is 40."

As we go forward, the traffic on the left has a clear giveaway sign, so they need to give way to the traffic approaching from our lane. We needed to adjust our speed as the traffic in the distance was slow-moving, but Luke ends up braking quite abruptly as he thought he had to give way to the traffic.

I think we had priority."
all right when we get to the next roundabout we're going to be going ahead it's the second exit sign posted towards heathrow our exit is positioned at 10 o'clock which means we need to start in the left-hand lane for an easier exit the diagram has quite a thick line for our exit as well as a green background which means we're heading onto an a road most likely a dual carriageway [Music] okay as we enter the roundabout luke moves in too far towards the left as if he's taking the first exit this position can be quite confusing for traffic behind him so he gets a minor fault for control and steering at this point [Music] so coming up to the next roundabout i'd like you to turn right there exit please traveling at 40 miles per hour when you can see the warning signs that the roundabout is approaching it's a good idea to switch lanes in good time luke does have a really good approach,1134.48,1251.76,891,195,3AWwFLIga_E,2112,https://youtu.be/3AWwFLIga_E?t=1134,"Critical level: 3.

Always keep your eyes on the road and check your mirrors frequently. Coming up, we have a roundabout. Remember to yield to the traffic already on the roundabout and use your indicator when exiting. Also, keep in mind the speed limit; we don't want any unnecessary fines. Now, we will be taking a left turn. Make sure to signal in advance and check your blind spot. And finally, we have reached our destination. Remember to always park in a safe and legal spot. Congratulations, you have passed your driving test!"

The focus was on finding a parking spot and securing the car.,"already rushing and didn't give the bus enough space to pass safely. You need to work on your timing and not feel pressured to rush.

Next, let's talk about the roundabout. You took the correct exit, but you need to signal and check your mirrors more before changing lanes. You also need to maintain a consistent speed and not slow down too much in the roundabout.

When turning right at the end of the road, you didn't check your blind spot and almost cut off the cyclist. Always check your mirrors and blind spot before making a turn.

Overall, you have some areas to work on but also some strengths to build upon. Make sure to practice and focus on your timing, signaling, and checking your mirrors and blind spot. Good luck!"
like uh-oh yeah okay so again right at the get-go kind of going forward not the end of the world you put it in reverse you looked around great you reversed and you even got into that space great yeah and then what happened i got scared because i feel like i annoyed everyone like yes it was a bit of an inconvenience but you know you handled it you needed to just carry on and go yeah i can do this you kept rolling and then that car's behind now they're hooting you that's where the serious fault came in okay okay i kind of thought it was point of narrator yeah even like going forward with the bus it was just like oh um didn't like it yeah because obviously the road is the bus is right there and i'm like what's she doing i kind of miss charge i thought there was a space maybe okay so that was the bus scenario what about the junction where i had to tell you to stop yeah i don't really know what happened there,1472.799,1531.679,917,196,_BeI7I_Vxb8,1732,https://youtu.be/_BeI7I_Vxb8?t=1472,"Critical level: 6 - The situation became critical when the car behind started honking, indicating that it was a potentially dangerous situation.","""Like, uh-oh, yeah.

You needed to just carry on and go, 'Yeah, I can do this.' You kept rolling, and then that car's behind, now they're hooting you. That's where the serious fault came in. Okay, okay. I kind of thought it was pointed out by the narrator. Yeah, even like going forward with the bus, it was just like, 'Oh, um, didn't like it.' Yeah, because obviously the road is the bus is right there, and I'm like, 'What's she doing?' I kind of missed the charge. I thought there was a space, maybe. Okay, so that was the bus scenario.

so you're at this roundabout you're approaching you're about to turn right you can see a van and you've kind of gone over the giveaway line and i thought she'll stop she'll stop and then i had to tell you to stop yeah yeah so it's a bit dangerous it's very interesting yeah um obviously yeah you understand that i don't need to yeah i don't need to elaborate on that one so we're all good now the last mistake you didn't realize and that you know what funny enough with this route that's the one fault that i kind of expected okay purely because it is a tricky turn so we're making a right turn you know where you stalled next to the petrol station the second floor the second stop so we're coming up to this traffic lights term right and you're in the right hand lane and there are actually two lanes that turn right okay you've gone in the right one which is the overtaking lane which is fine as you've,1534.159,1582.0,904,195,_BeI7I_Vxb8,1732,https://youtu.be/_BeI7I_Vxb8?t=1534,"entered it safely and there were no other vehicles around, so I would rate the driving situation as a 2, as it wasn't critical at all.","gone over the give way line you did come to a stop but then you started creeping forward I had to remind you a few times to look left and then eventually you did see the car and then you stopped okay so just be careful on the approach okay so we're at this roundabout okay and we're approaching we're about to turn right you can see a van and you've kind of gone over the give way line and I thought she'll stop she'll stop and then I had to tell you to stop. Yeah, yeah. So, it's a bit dangerous. It's very interesting. Yeah, um, obviously, yeah, you understand that. I don't need to elaborate on that one, so we're all good now. The last mistake you didn't realize, and you know what, funny enough, with this route, that's the one fault that I kind of expected, okay? Purely because it is a tricky turn. So, we're making a right turn. You know, where you stalled next to the petrol station, the second floor, the second stop. So, we're coming up to this traffic light, turn right, and you're in the right-hand lane, and there are actually two lanes that turn right.

gone into the turn you've switched back into the left lane okay there was a red car there they weren't like right here or they weren't trying to overtake you but they could have been and you've not checked you've just kind of moved over okay so if you've started in the right-hand lane and you're making the right turn what should you have done stay right stayed right and then switched over later yeah yeah so that's my name yeah that's it follow your lane that was the other one um besides that um we had two stalls yeah i feel like i never you never stole i was just about to say you never stole as soon as we started there's that stall and then the van was giving way and then the other saw when can you do that what's one more store the other store was when you had the other store where you were in the second year trying to move off yeah that was that was bad the reversing on the right was good but i feel like you probably could have,1584.159,1635.2,942,201,_BeI7I_Vxb8,1732,https://youtu.be/_BeI7I_Vxb8?t=1584,"Critical rating: 4. 

While the situation described involves a potential lane change without proper checking, it is not an immediate threat to safety as the red car was not overtaking. However, it still raises concerns of proper lane awareness and caution. The mention of two stalls also indicate challenges in handling the vehicle, but it does not pose a direct danger at the moment.","Gone into the turn, you've switched back into the left lane. Okay, there was a red car there. They weren't right here, or they weren't trying to overtake you, but they could have been, and you've not checked. You've just kind of moved over. Okay, so if you've started in the right-hand lane and you're making a right turn, what should you have done? Stay right, stayed right, and then switched over later. Yeah, yeah, so that's my name. Yeah, that's it. Follow your lane. That was the other one. Besides that, we had two stalls. Yeah, I feel like I never, you never stalled. I was just about to say, you never stalled as soon as we started. There's that stall, and then the van was giving way, and then the other stall, when can you do that? What's one more stall?

You will see the driver being asked to perform various maneuvers, and their driving skills will be assessed based on their ability to follow instructions, maintain control of the vehicle, and follow traffic laws.

First, the examiner will ask the driver to adjust their mirrors and seat for comfort and safety. The driver will then be asked to start the car and demonstrate their ability to use the brakes, accelerator, and steering wheel.

Next, the driver will be asked to make various turns, including left and right turns, and a U-turn. The driver will also be asked to park the car in a parallel parking spot.

Throughout the test, the examiner will be watching the driver carefully and taking notes. The examiner will be looking for any mistakes, such as failing to use turn signals or stopping too suddenly.

At the end of the test, the examiner will provide feedback to the driver and let them know if they passed or failed. If the driver fails, they will be given the opportunity to retake the test at a later date.

Remember, it is important to always follow traffic laws, drive safely and defensively, and be aware of your surroundings while you are behind the wheel. Good luck on your driving test!"

Welcome to a driving test video. So today, I'm going to show you how to do your driving test. So the first thing you're going to want to do when you get into the car is to just take a deep breath, relax, and just kind of feel the car out. Make sure that you know how to operate all of the different gears and making sure that you know how to signal properly. So the first thing that you're going to want to do is to indicate that you're pulling out onto the road. So make sure that you signal and then check your mirrors just to make sure that there's no other cars coming. And then, once you've done that, you can slowly start to pull out onto the road. And as you're driving down the road, you want to make sure that you're staying in your lane and that you're not driving too close to the car in front of you. You also want to be looking in your mirrors quite often just to make sure that there's no other cars coming up behind you. And then when it comes time to turn, make sure that you signal well in advance of the turn and then slow down accordingly. And then once you've made the turn, just make sure that you're staying in your lane and that you're not cutting off any other cars. And then, as you continue down the road, just try to stay as relaxed as possible and try not to make any sudden movements with the car. So that's basically it. That's how you do your driving test. So hopefully this video was helpful. And if you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments below. Thanks for watching, and good luck on your driving test. [Music]"

was next to me yeah and you moved in front of them didn't you yeah and then we had to move back to the left later yeah so you actually switched Lanes there yeah I switched Lanes like as we got on yeah because I thought we always we have to be on the left if we're not overtaking no true but when you started at those traffic lights which lane were you in the the there was only two lanes right there were three there were three I was in the middle you were on the left I'll show you later so that was the first bit obviously that's a mistake because you've just switched over Lanes the guy's having to blast the horn even the Lorry is using the hall at that point yeah yeah I was quite a bit of a weird one because nothing's really going on and you've just you've just drifted over okay yeah besides that I want to talk about your roundabouts because that's where the trouble seems to be for me me too firstly a bit of hesitation you,1613.52,1662.36,933,203,aqad7PfuzsM,2019,https://youtu.be/aqad7PfuzsM?t=1613,"Criticality rating: 5 - The situation is not extremely critical, but the student's lane change without checking blind spots caused a potentially dangerous situation and required other drivers to use their horns.","were next to me, yeah, and you moved in front of them, didn't you?

The... there were only two lanes, right? There were three. There were three. I was in the middle, you were on the left. I'll show you later. So that was the first bit. Obviously, that's a mistake because you've just switched lanes. The guy's having to blast the horn. Even the lorry is using the horn at that point. Yeah. It was quite a bit of a weird one because nothing's really going on, and you've just drifted over. Okay.

Yeah, when you went into that roundabout initially, you started the roundabout in the left lane. As you enter the roundabout, you've drawn a straight line across the two lanes and then head back out. So I wasn't like in the right lane. Yeah, I was just in the middle of two lanes. So you started in the left one, but both need to go in and go like that.

then I'm gonna exit on the left one oh so you're kind of drawing a straight path between these two lanes your General Drive is really good like you're using your mirror signaling positioning your clutch control your observation at small Junctions that's all really good hesitation on roundabouts for sure you don't realize when to go in yeah and um when you're leaving when you're you're Lane discipline on the roundabout itself and when you need to move left so we're going to go and practice some of this now so you can see it yeah yeah that's what I kind of thought as well I haven't really done much roundabout you haven't um I've done a few but like not big ones like I've done the the small ones but I haven't really like practiced a lot on them on the big ones yeah um I could kind of tell yeah you kind of um you weren't that confident on them because what you have to do in roundabouts is even though you've,1861.02,1910.52,916,197,aqad7PfuzsM,2019,https://youtu.be/aqad7PfuzsM?t=1861,done your observation and you know it's clear you still need to be confident in your decision making so I would rate this situation a 7 because the hesitation on roundabouts can be dangerous and requires improvement.,got the right of way you still have to be aware of what other people are doing so if you see someone indicating to come into your lane you have to just be aware of that and maybe slow down a little bit but keep going and the other thing with roundabouts as well is just knowing when to exit it's really important so if you're going to exit on the fourth exit you want to start indicating to the left as soon as you pass the third exit just so that people are aware that you're going to be coming off but yeah so we'll go and practice some roundabouts I think that would be good for you.

That's why we've done like the cockpit drill and everything. We've never done anything, I see. Yeah, but since then, you've done 40 hours and you had a test, yes, which was the pencil - failed.

Critical level: 2. This is a simple question before the lesson begins and does not relate to driving in traffic.","pull the dipstick out you check the oil level and it should be between the minimum and maximum marks on the dipstick. Alright, cool, let's get started. 

During the drive, please follow the road ahead. Whenever I need you to turn, I will give you clear instructions. I will not be giving any hints, so please drive as carefully as possible. 

Our drive will include one maneuver and a potential emergency stop.

Quick question before we begin: where would you find the engine oil, and how do you check if it is at the correct level?

You can find the engine oil underneath the bonnet. When you pull out the dipstick, you will see a line on it. The oil should be between the minimum and maximum marks on the dipstick.

Alright, we're ready to go."

All right so here we are at the beginning of the test. Our first task is going to be our general knowledge questions. So the first question is what is the legal blood alcohol limit in this state? The legal blood alcohol limit in this state is point zero eight percent. Question number two is what do you do if your driving tire blows out? When your driving tire blows out, your first step is to grasp the steering wheel firmly, let off the accelerator slowly and steer straight ahead. You want to avoid and prevent any sudden movements. Question number three is what is the hand signal for a right turn? Hand signal for a right turn is your left hand up, your hand and space signal turning to the right.

So first, when we got there, you didn't stop behind the line, you went over the line. That's all. That first black car had to swerve, you, yeah, so that was a serious fault in itself. Okay, then the fact that you tried to move off, you stalled, so that didn't help, but the stall wasn't the serious fault.

you couldn't so the fact that he was so far away we should have we should have just gone wrong with it yeah and then when I entered the road I went a bit into water yeah and there was a car in the other lane so there's a few things on that one Junction alone so you should have really taken care of things when I hit jump well I thought I hit something I think that's when the nerves kicked in there yeah it was other than that I was I was all right and then there was that point where I had to take control with the break do you remember yeah the car the car yeah yeah so meeting situation there's um Park cars on the right there's a car coming towards you you can see it but you're kind of just squeezing into that space and I was like oh no don't do it I should have stopped I should have stopped before that's when afterwards I was stopping before yeah I still I was like okay so yeah new reverse Park here at the end okay,1587.299,1635.6,926,200,7ttnVx9fCIA,1885,https://youtu.be/7ttnVx9fCIA?t=1587,"Criticality: 8 - There were multiple critical situations in this fragment, including entering a road with a car in the other lane, hitting the jump, taking control with the brake, and squeezing into a tight space with a car coming towards the driver.","You couldn't, so the fact that he was so far away, we should have just gone along with it.

Now, traveling a bit further down this road, there's a bit more traffic, and Joe gets another serious fault for position. Normal driving, as he's very much positioned on the white line to the right.

Today we'll be doing a driving test with our learner driver here. He's going to be starting the car and pulling out of the parking lot. Okay, let's get started.

[Car engine starts and driver checks mirrors]

Okay, now you can slowly start to move forward. Check your surroundings and keep an eye out for pedestrians and other cars coming your way. Remember to always stay within the speed limit and use your turn signals when needed. 

[Driver enters roundabout]

You're doing great so far, just remember to pay attention to the signs and yield at the roundabouts. 

[Driver turns left without using turn signal]

Uh-oh, you missed using your turn signal there. Always remember to use your signals before turning or changing lanes. Let's continue on and see how you do with parallel parking.

[Driver attempts parallel parking and hits a cone]

Okay, that wasn't quite right. Try to align the car properly using your mirrors and backup camera. Remember, practice makes perfect. 

[Driver drives back to starting point]

Alright, we're back at the starting point. While that wasn't perfect, there's plenty of room for improvement. Keep practicing, stay focused and safe on the roads. Thanks for watching and we'll see you next time!"

watching this video you are probably either really excited to take your
driving test or you're really nervous I'm just gonna give you a quick little run
through of what's gonna happen when you get there so you have some idea of what
to expectfirst thing you're gonna do is you're gonna meet your examiner
in a waiting room usually when you get there there's a bunch of other people
waiting to take their test too and you're all just kind of sitting
around trying to look casual you don't really speak to anyone there's always a
guy there who's like trying to strike conversations and nobody
really wants to talk to that guy so just keep to yourself keep cool calm collected
and when the examinator comes in they're gonna call your name they're gonna
take you out to the car and you're gonna do your basic checks so they're gonna
ask to see your driver's license your insurance and your registration you're
gonna walk around the car with them and you're gonna check that all your lights
and your indicators are working your brake lights your reverse lights your tail lights
and you're gonna show them that you know how to pop the hood and check the oil
and that the wipers and you know all that basic stuff when you're done with that
they're gonna hop in the car with you and they're gonna ask you one really basic
question it's always the same question for everyone in every state I know in
California it's always the same question so I'm just gonna tell you what it is
so you don't have to worry about that it's really something simple like
what would you do if the car in front of you suddenly stopped or you know what's
the speed limit on this road the idea is just to basically make sure that you
understand how to answer a simple question and that you understand basic
road rules once you've answered your question they'll give you directions and you'll
start driving

Explanation: The situation is somewhat critical as the driver is committing a driving fault by not checking mirrors before signaling, which can develop into a serious habit.","E-Class. It was the same thing but physical, right? Okay, let's try not to suck. [Music] Good start. Take the next road on your right. The road that we're turning into is actually a one-way road. As we enter, there are one-way signs on both sides facing outwards, so we can enter on the right-hand side of this road. Now, Rafe is an experienced driver with 15 years of driving experience. He sometimes has a tendency to keep his left hand on the gearbox. Now, this isn't necessarily going to give you a fault as long as you don't lose control of the steering, but it's a good idea to keep both hands on the steering wheel for better control. [Music] At the end of this road, turn right. He does not check his mirrors before signaling. He also hasn't had any relevant prior updates, so this is a driving fault. If this continues, it can easily become a habitual serious fault for not checking mirrors before signaling. So always check your mirrors before indicating left or right before turns."

Before starting to drive in the rain, turn on your demisters so that your windows don't steam up as you're driving. Also, be familiar with the windscreen wipers as you may need to adjust the speed on the go. There are lots of factors to consider when driving in the rain. As your following distance and braking distance need to be doubled, so don't drive too fast. [Music] Foreign [Music]."

if I'm if the clutch is down so we we was coasting onto that that's why I had to break and even kind of approaching a lot of the stops there's a lot of sudden kind of movements really um you just need to take your time with these things now let's talk about that Lorry when you try to overtake him what happened there well I tried to stick to the speed limit yeah this guy was crawling I tried when you say crawling how slow was it when you initially decided I believe he was just going if I remember I think I was like correct me if I'm wrong you obviously see on the video I want to say I was like from 30 to 35 just when I so I pulled onto the Dual Carriage Bridge yeah and he just moved in front of us hadn't he yeah yeah you know you're saying he was slow he was when he come in he was a bit slow but he was trying to get on with it okay so,1795.86,1842.179,845,195,_TzNVpdxtmY,2077,https://youtu.be/_TzNVpdxtmY?t=1795,"Critical level: 5 - The situation is somewhat critical as there are sudden movements and a need to take time while approaching stops, but the overtaking situation with the Lorry was not extremely dangerous.","If the clutch is down, we were coasting onto that. That's why I had to brake. And even approaching a lot of the stops, there's a lot of sudden movements. Really, you just need to take your time with these things. Now, let's talk about that lorry. When you tried to overtake him, what happened there? Well, I tried to stick to the speed limit. Yeah, this guy was crawling. When you say crawling, how slow was it when you initially decided? I believe he was just going. If I remember, I think it was like, correct me if I'm wrong, you obviously see on the video. I want to say I was like from 30 to 35 when I pulled onto the dual carriageway. Yeah, and he just moved in front of us, hadn't he? Yeah. You know you're saying he was slow. He was when he came in.

when you decided to overtake him he was trying to speed up as well yeah yeah and now we're level with him and then you're eager to move over and he's right there yeah yeah so you don't really need to overtake him that was it I didn't because I did but he turned left he turned in and he was he was trying to get up to the speed of the road yeah yeah I was just yeah I just thought I thought I tried to get some brownie points you know everything came in the right lane but uh and then the point where I had to grab the steering with the van when you said what's his van doing in the middle that one is online as well because there's puddles everywhere and you could see what he was in in the middle and you should have taken a bit more charge then yeah so do you think I should have just stopped completely we should have slowed down and stopped here if not slowly went through that but you kind of carried on with your speed as well,1843.86,1885.08,933,203,_TzNVpdxtmY,2077,https://youtu.be/_TzNVpdxtmY?t=1843,"7 - The situation was critical as the learner driver wanted to overtake a car that was speeding up and ended up being in a dangerous position alongside it.

I didn't, because I did, but he turned left. He turned in and he was trying to get up to the speed of the road. Yeah, yeah. I was just, yeah, I just thought I tried to get some brownie points, you know, everything came in the right lane. But the point where I had to grab the steering wheel of the van, when you said, ""What's his van doing in the middle,"" that one is online as well because there's puddles everywhere and you could see he was in the middle. And you should have taken a bit more charge then. Yeah, so do you think I should have just stopped completely? We should have slowed down and stopped here. If not, slowly went through that, but you kind of carried on with your speed as well."
but it's better off just stopping really okay what are the positives because I just feel like I'm getting more than that obviously of course you know how to control your car but the car that you're driving in is different from this one so a lot of the times there was a bit of a bit of coordination off you know when you were accelerating yeah yeah that's just something that you can smooth out with a bit of um just getting familiar with the biting point a bit more but yeah you know what you're doing on the roads but you don't read the road markings you're right you remember when we did that um that time when we had a gravy and W behind us and I said at the end of the road turn right this is after your remark of my mum said um anyone can drive in a straight line we're going up to the end of this road and I said turn right at the end we come up to this bit where this road is kind,1886.64,1927.38,888,192,_TzNVpdxtmY,2077,https://youtu.be/_TzNVpdxtmY?t=1886,"6 - The situation is not extremely critical, but the driver's lack of attention to road markings can cause confusion and potential danger for themselves and other drivers on the road.",of bending and you just went straight on because you weren't looking at the road markings you need to make sure that you're you're reading the road and actually following the signs and road markings and things like that so um that's one thing to work on as well but overall I think you've got the basics down you just need a bit more practice to smooth things out and you know become more confident on the road okay so let's go back and we'll continue the rest of the test all right.

Welcome to your driving test first of all can I have your provisional licence please Thank You

Great. Thank you very much. Now, before we get on the road, I'm going to ask you some safety checks about this vehicle, okay? First of all, can you show me where the brake lights are? Brilliant. And can you put the hazard lights on for me, please? Thank you. Can you show me how you would check that all four tires have sufficient tread depth? Great. And can you show me how you would check the headlights and tail lights are working? Perfect. Thank you very much. 

Now, we're going to start your driving test. As you can see, the test will be 40 minutes long, and we will cover lots of different roads and conditions. Our main priority throughout the test is safety, so you must always follow the rules of the road and drive in a safe and responsible manner. Okay? 

Great. Let's get started. First of all, I'd like you to drive out of this car park and turn left onto the main road. When it's safe to do so, of course."

If you just give me a few minutes. Hey David, how's your test? I made a few mistakes and then, look, I had to do the emergency stop. Yeah, what about it? I didn't look around. Yeah, yeah, I forgot. You remember? I reminded you that earlier. Okay, so for a fast mock test, there's not a lot of serious faults, but there are quite a lot of minors."
need to cut down on those definitely um so unfortunately no it wouldn't be a pass now the main reason why it wouldn't be a pass is there's a few which I'm going to highlight for you so firstly the emergency stop after you've stopped in the middle of the road I've said do you think you could drive off and you simply yeah yeah definitely you need to look around okay we're in the middle of the road you need to check your blind spots like this and once you've stopped after an emergency stops to secure the car as well so you're not in a rush to get away the next thing was the way we approached that roundabout back there you know where we did that right turn there was like a gray Passat yeah there's a car for me right you waited for him but only just and then the town on the roundabouts quite fast wasn't it oh yeah that one yeah yeah so we approached that a bit too fast now with that Lorry just now why did I,1235.22,1284.78,915,200,-aM_Yt-zLe0,1585,https://youtu.be/-aM_Yt-zLe0?t=1235,"give it a 7, because the student made critical errors during an emergency stop and approaching a roundabout too fast.","need to cut down on those. Definitely um, so unfortunately, no, it wouldn't be a pass. Now, the main reason why it wouldn't be a pass is there are a few, which I'm going to highlight for you. So firstly, the emergency stop. After you've stopped in the middle of the road, I've said, ""Do you think you could drive off?"" And you simply said, ""Yeah, yeah, definitely."" You need to look around. Okay, we're in the middle of the road, you need to check your blind spots like this, and once you've stopped after an emergency stop, secure the car as well, so you're not in a rush to get away. The next thing was the way we approached that roundabout back there. You know where we did that right turn, there was like a grey Passat. Yeah, there's a car for me, right? You waited for him, but only just. And then, the turn on the roundabouts quite fast, wasn't it? Oh yeah, that one, yeah. So, we approached that a bit too fast. Now, with that Lorry just now, why did I need to slow 'back'?"
grab the wheel oh it's toothless yeah he was very fast wasn't he okay did you notice how fast and how close he was coming to you now as we're driving along there isn't much we can do but because he's coming in at that speed close to you you needed to at least slow down and move left you're carrying on on as normal and I've had to grab the wheel there because he would have honestly hit that Wing mirror if I didn't take control okay so even if it's someone else's fault we need to yeah be a bit more defensive how was the rest of the drive how are the how are the roundabouts in the first half I didn't get that now go the part oh emergency stop part that's when I start doing more mistakes oh yeah after that we definitely had more definitely okay so in the first half I felt like we got away with a lot of the minor faults because there wasn't a lot of traffic around us like you were being,1286.76,1340.34,894,197,-aM_Yt-zLe0,1585,https://youtu.be/-aM_Yt-zLe0?t=1286,"Critical level: 8 - The situation was critical as the other driver was driving very fast and dangerously close, causing the instructor to grab the wheel and avoid a potential accident.","Grab the wheel!

Now, as we're driving along, there isn't much we can do, but because he's coming in at that speed, close to you, you needed to at least slow down and move left. You're carrying on as normal and I've had to grab the wheel there because he would have honestly hit that wing mirror if I didn't take control. Okay, so even if it's someone else's fault, we need to be a bit more defensive. How was the rest of the drive? How were the roundabouts in the first half? I didn't get that, now go the part, oh, emergency stop part. That's when I start doing more mistakes. Oh yeah, after that we definitely had more, definitely.

safe you're checking your mirrors and sorts but I felt like if we had a bit more going on or the traffic around us was a bit faster we could have had a few faults on the first half as well so there's a few I want to talk about so firstly you know that roundabout where we were going straight you went into the right hand lane to go straight didn't you yeah do we need to be on the right no no we should have been on the left haven't we so you've started on the right and you you did check your mirrors you've signaled and everything but like I said if there was traffic on your left you would have now been panicking going oh where am I going yeah yeah and also the Gap that you took like it's a pretty small Gap but I feel like you need to start moving into these roundabouts with a bit more speed because that's a gap you can take but you've got to be quick with it so you'd normally see like experienced,1342.5,1387.08,906,199,-aM_Yt-zLe0,1585,https://youtu.be/-aM_Yt-zLe0?t=1342,"Driving situation: 6/10. 

While the situation was generally safe, there were a few faults that needed to be addressed, and if the traffic around them was moving faster or there was more going on, it could have been more critical.","Safe. You're checking your mirrors and such, but I felt like if we had a bit more going on or the traffic around us was a bit faster, we could have had a few faults on the first half as well. So there's a few I want to talk about. Firstly, you know that roundabout where we were going straight? You went into the right-hand lane to go straight, didn't you? Yeah. Do we need to be on the right? No, we should have been on the left, haven't we? So, you started on the right, and you did check your mirrors, you signaled, and everything. But, like I said, if there was traffic on your left, you would have now been panicking, going, ""Oh, where am I going?"" Yeah. And also, the gap that you took, it's a pretty small gap, but I feel like you need to start moving into these roundabouts with a bit more speed, because that's a gap you can take, but you've got to be quick with it. So you'd normally see experienced drivers take that gap and go."
drivers going in for that sort of Gap yeah so you've got to be quick if you're gonna go otherwise don't go okay um you remember that other round but we were making like a left turn as we're about to go on the carriageway with the stadiums in front of us now you stalled there didn't you yeah okay you know if that's all there was honestly a blessing in disguise for you had you taken that Gap that would have been a serious fault because there was traffic coming in from the right on a 40 year old so even though it looked clear but as soon as you go in there's traffic that's slightly further but coming in at 40 like possibly yeah yeah so that wasn't an ideal Gap so I would honestly make sure that the road is completely clear the traffic is stopping before I take that Gap there because of the speed that they can come in okay um then we did a few stops and a few right turns on the roundabouts with the,1388.88,1438.44,907,197,-aM_Yt-zLe0,1585,https://youtu.be/-aM_Yt-zLe0?t=1388,"stadiums which weren't too critical, I would rate it as a 3 out of 10, but the previous situation of the potential serious fault was a 9 out of 10 in terms of criticality.",stadiums on our left yeah you did well with those clutch control was good so you didn't stall this time and you got the gears sorted without any problems the only thing to watch out for is that you're keeping to the left-hand side of your lane when you're actually turning left okay you tend to drift a little bit to the right so just be conscious of staying left but other than that your observations are good you're checking both mirrors which is great  when you're coming up to the roundabout you're checking the right-hand mirror which is good because you want to see if you've got any motorbikes that are coming up fast you're checking the left mirror because you want to see any cyclists or anything like that and then you're also checking the centre mirror to see what the car behind you is doing so they're good observations good signal good gears and your Clarences good as well so just a little bit of work on staying left but you're doing really well apart from that.

The situation is relatively critical as the learner driver is struggling with staying in her lane on a roundabout, which could be dangerous if there were more traffic around.","Thank you. Drive up when you're ready. [Music] As we're going a bit further, I did have to use the dual controls for a pedestrian on the left-hand side as Simon doesn't realize they're about to cross. [Music] ""Foreign"". [Music] You got it. [Music] Okay, back to you. You got it, yes. Okay. [Music] Go right on the roundabout and take the third exit towards Oxford. Even if you feel like you've made a serious mistake and you may have failed your driving test, it's really important to keep driving safely and not to dwell on that mistake. Simon is still a little bit flustered at this point as she's still thinking about the zebra crossing, and as we've entered this roundabout, she's not stayed in her lane and drifts over in towards the left lane. If there had been more traffic around us, this would have been a dangerous mistake. [Music]"

First, exit and turn left. [Music] Then turn left, south. [Music] After that, turn right. [Music] Follow the road round the head after 200 yards, cross the roundabout and take the second exit. Then you have reached your destination. 

At this point, the sat nav is saying to go straight ahead and we have reached the destination. 

However, the driver ends up making a right turn in the roundabout without signaling right. Going the wrong way is not a problem, but turning right on a roundabout without indicating is. 

Finally, the sat nav says ""destination"" repeatedly to indicate that you have arrived. Turn left and you will have reached your destination, but in this case, the driver ended up on the wrong side of the road. 

The instructor asks: ""All right, you got it?"" 

The driver responds: ""Yeah."" 

The instructor continues: ""Oh, what happened with this? How was your test?"" 

The driver replies: ""First, I tell the brick or the... yeah, I thought she's going there so I didn't see he's on the zebra. Yeah, first at the second that now he's there, I know.""

the test before the zebra Crossing how was it yeah yeah this is very good that's it yeah everything is good wrought about good the signal everything but after that what I did one District that's it that's exactly it otherwise the uh I dropped well and there is biggest problem you know what happened here you went the wrong way I think we have some trouble following Sat Nav instructions aren't you what what mistake I did here when I come I I said this is a Tar this is not Junction yeah because okay so let me let me talk about yeah you you thought it was a 10 but then on the wrong side we were turning on the wrong side that's when I had to grab the wheel I tried to write yeah so you're supposed to go on the left and then turn but you were turning from the right so I had to grab the wheel back yes yes but let's talk about um I feel like a lot of the issues I want to get you used to following Sat Nav a bit more now because,1007.88,1068.72,931,202,yQ84-NHrgV8,1305,https://youtu.be/yQ84-NHrgV8?t=1007,"Criticality: 8.

Otherwise, the, uh, I dropped, well, and there is the biggest problem. You know what happened here? You went the wrong way. I think we have some trouble following Sat Nav instructions. Aren't you? What mistake did I do here when I came? I said this is a turn, this is not a junction, yeah? Because, okay, so let me talk about it. You thought it was a turn, but then on the wrong side, we were turning on the wrong side. That's when I had to grab the wheel. I tried to write, yeah. So you're supposed to go on the left and then turn, but you were turning from the right, so I had to grab the wheel back. Yes, yes, but let's talk about, I feel like a lot of the issues. I want to get you used to following Sat Nav a bit more now because..."
you know on the sat nav you can see the blue line right yes yes even if you're not listening to her you can just see the Blue Line make sure you're following that line yeah because back there there was a roundabout yeah um the sat nav was telling you to go straight and you made a right turn with no signal okay and then we went down that icy road we were not meant to go down there you went the wrong way oh good because that level saying go straight that's why I said I bound about go straight yeah and you turned right yeah yeah I took right yeah we were supposed to go straight okay yeah so I want to get you used to following alongside followers not uh but we're not going the wrong way is not a problem but you made a right turn with no signal okay there was a car coming towards us yes yes how do they know you're gonna turn right yes yes sir yeah yeah so going the wrong ways it wasn't the problem so let's talk about the test,1069.86,1120.799,934,200,yQ84-NHrgV8,1305,https://youtu.be/yQ84-NHrgV8?t=1069,"Criticality: 7 - The situation is quite critical as the driver made a wrong turn on an icy road without using a signal, which could have caused an accident with an oncoming car.","""You know, on the sat nav, you can see the blue line, right?""

so the first half of the test was really nice you were you were doing really well but instructions with the sat nav is definitely a bit of a concern so I'm going to get you used to like kind of looking and following that a bit more now after this yeah um the roundabout greenford going straight was very nice the maneuver parallel parking you did that really well just keep it a bit more controlled on that downhill bit okay because it was starting to go yeah you did really well with looking around you knew that learner car was waiting so you looked at them they're like what are they doing and then they carried on waiting so you carried on so it was good but there's the biggest problem I got because I don't realize there is a junction and oh yeah I I don't I think what happened is like you said because that one mistake happened yeah I mean more happened yeah oh straight afterwards when you break I said oh my God this is this is something that you,1122.059,1170.6,956,193,yQ84-NHrgV8,1305,https://youtu.be/yQ84-NHrgV8?t=1122,"I would rate this situation as a 6, as there were some concerns with the driver's ability to follow instructions with the sat nav and a notable mistake at a junction during the lesson.",should have noticed so just make sure you're checking all your mirrors and being aware of your surroundings at all times it's really important to be safe on the road so just keep that in mind but overall you did a really good job just need to work on those few things and then you'll be ready for your test.
know in confusion I put race did you realize when at that point at that point I didn't realize you will see hmm I I I press the resume it's because I was pressing the brake and you were pressing the accelerator because you didn't want to stop for her I've stopped first one stop really on the edge the one mistake makes me very but this is something that we need to learn from now so okay yes we definitely should have seen her but even after that mistake happened you've got to drive safely right okay because all the other mistakes happen because your your mind is still stuck yeah yeah on that one thing and then rest is good the first time was really good and then this is first I practice we haven't been here for a while we did this ages ago remember in your first mock test yeah yeah yeah we did it then yeah so it has been a while since we've been to this roundabout yeah it's very good but need more condensation yeah so we're definitely gonna go and work on,1173.419,1234.02,967,201,yQ84-NHrgV8,1305,https://youtu.be/yQ84-NHrgV8?t=1173,"Critical level: 3 - The situation is not very critical as the car has already stopped and the mistake has been identified, but it is still important to drive safely and be cautious of mistakes.","I know, in my confusion I put on the race.

I pressed the resume, it's because I was pressing the brake and you were pressing the accelerator because you didn't want to stop for her. I've stopped first, one stop really on the edge. The one mistake makes me very, but this is something that we need to learn from now. so, okay. Yes, we definitely should have seen her. But even after that mistake happened, you've got to drive safely, right? Okay. Because all the other mistakes happen because your mind is still stuck, yeah, yeah, on that one thing. And then rest is good. The first time was really good and then this is first I practice. We haven't been here for a while. We did this ages ago, remember in your first mock test? Yeah, yeah, yeah. We did it then. Yeah, so it has been a while since we've been to this roundabout. Yeah, it's very good but needs more condensation. Yeah, so we're definitely gonna go and work on."
some of these things now um this is good and you know when you're driving because it was like okay sorry there was like a little bit of hesitation on some Junctions like the mini roundabout earlier so we need to make sure we're working on that hesitation as well um on some of these roads because it's icy or it's foggy don't go all the way to 20 sometimes we were driving a bit fast okay so be careful with that oh yeah we're definitely gonna go work on the statlab now yeah sign up with yes and turning also yeah so we're gonna go and work on the sat nav and some of these Junctions now looking at Road markings a bit more clearly is that yes yeah all right well that's the end of our mock test video today um yeah still work to do but we've still got time so it's not concerning so don't worry yeah um major concern is clear now yeah like the clearance was really nice you know,1235.58,1283.64,880,193,yQ84-NHrgV8,1305,https://youtu.be/yQ84-NHrgV8?t=1235,"Critical level 3 - There were some minor issues with hesitation and speeding, but it is not a dangerous situation and can be improved with practice.","Some of these things, now, um, this is good and you know when you're driving because it was like, ""okay, sorry, there was a little bit of hesitation on some junctions like the mini roundabout earlier, so we need to make sure we're working on that hesitation as well.""

Okay, so you want to take your driver's license. This is the driving test video. Everyone is gonna have a different experience on their driving test. They might ask you to do different things. They might take you on different roads. So don't be nervous. Just relax and drive.


So first things first. They're gonna ask for your driver's license and your proof of insurance. You don't have those, you're not a fan. Make sure you bring those.


Then they're gonna ask you to turn on the car and make sure that your brake lights and your signal lights are working. So make sure you do that.


Then you're going to drive around the parking lot to make sure that you're feeling comfortable in the car. So you're going to go left, you're going to go right, and you're going to go straight. And they're going to watch you while you're doing that.

And then after that, you're going to drive on the road. It might be a busy road, it might be a quiet road, it just depends on where you are. So make sure that you're really paying attention to the road signs, the speed limit, if there's any pedestrians, if there's any animals.


Then you might have to parallel park or back up around a cone. So make sure that you've practiced that before.


And then after that, you might have to do a three-point turn or a u-turn. So make sure that you're practicing those things before.


And then that's pretty much it. They might give you a couple of other tasks or things to do, but it just depends on where you are.


So just make sure that you're really paying attention and you're really relaxed and you're really ready to do this.

Yeah, what was going through your head at that point? Want to do it or not? And then I just went off. It was already sixth point to try and overtake because at any point, I was just thinking somebody can come on the corner.

really well there's lots of really good things but you do need to sort out your approach speed approach speed yeah you sometimes get to roundabouts a bit too fast okay you know you did okay be under 20. it depends on the roundabout like if the roundabout's Fairly open the lanes are quite wide and you're kind of smoothly kind of going around yeah but if the roundabout's quite tight and now you're having to wiggle through you're still keeping it in fourth gear and the car just feels like [Music] you know where where earlier we had the double roundabout yeah yeah that nearly gave you a fault there because nearly gave you a serious thought really because you're going through that the first round about position was great okay but you kept it in fourth gear and it felt fast on the second round about we had that light blue car coming okay and I know we had the distance but what if we were now yeah and that right hand,1662.12,1708.559,923,192,zuSzGTFMLBA,2122,https://youtu.be/zuSzGTFMLBA?t=1662,"situation: 9 - The driving situation is very critical because the learner is approaching roundabouts at a high speed and keeping the car in fourth gear, which is not suitable for tight and wiggly roundabouts. Additionally, they almost caused a serious fault by not downshifting and maintaining the speed while approaching a second roundabout where another car was coming.",turn on the second roundabout was a bit sharper you wouldn't have been able to negotiate it safely in fourth gear you should have changed down to third gear and that's what I mean by approach speed you need to slow down to a speed that you can cope with and also taking consideration the road and traffic conditions so you need to be a bit slower when it's raining when the roads are wet or in busy areas and when you're coming up to junctions or crossings you need to start slowing down a bit more in advance for that so you've got plenty of time to react to any hazards that may arise and when you do slow down coming up to junctions or crossings do it smoothly and progressively starting by easing off the gas and then start applying a bit of brake so it's all gentle and progressive with your feet and your hands so that's what I mean by approach speed okay.
side yeah yeah yeah I did realize that yeah so definitely when you've got a junction a roundabout or you know you're going to be required to turn more definitely drop it down to three if not two depending on the size of the roundabout okay yeah yeah you can do it in fourth but not those roundabouts I wouldn't be ground Awards maybe yeah if it's like nobody's there you can just if you're not really required to turn then yes but if you're having to kind of Wiggle around you're asking for trouble with that one yeah yeah um yeah lots of really good things you were doing you were speeding up slowing down all of that was really nice it was just the approach speed that was bugging me a little bit okay cyclist in general cyclist in general played up three times yeah so first we had the uh I think it's the ubereats yeah it was on the High Street I took uh I went to you kept going close to him and you couldn't,1710.419,1757.34,913,197,zuSzGTFMLBA,2122,https://youtu.be/zuSzGTFMLBA?t=1710,"Critical level: 6.

getting to those roundabouts a bit too quickly okay okay yeah let me reduce it down to maybe third and second gear yeah depending on the size of the route and then uh did you think we were a bit fast when we took those in fourth gear yeah yeah it was fast sometimes uh maybe because of the way I the change of Gears right I might not have adjusted so quickly yeah but I was a bit fast in one or two roundabouts that I felt maybe I could reduce the speed yeah but I was your car has made me overjoy yes and then I have to fish yeah so definitely just a little slower for the roundabout yep yep but yeah your major concern would have just been the tooth like this um so yeah just be a little bit more careful with cyclists because they are more vulnerable aren't they yeah and we don't want to be putting them in danger generally when it comes to cyclists there are three points where you shouldn't overtake do you know,1859.159,1910.7,917,194,zuSzGTFMLBA,2122,https://youtu.be/zuSzGTFMLBA?t=1859,Critical level: 5 - The situation is somewhat critical due to the need to reduce speed for roundabouts and be cautious of cyclists to avoid putting them in danger.,"Getting to those roundabouts a bit too quickly. Okay, let me reduce it down to maybe third and second gear depending on the size of the roundabout. Did you think we were a bit fast when we took those in fourth gear? Yeah, it was fast. Sometimes maybe because of the way I changed gears right, I might not have adjusted so quickly. Yeah, but I was a bit fast in one or two roundabouts that I felt maybe I could reduce the speed. But I was overjoyed with your car, and then I have to fish, so definitely just a little slower for the roundabout. Yep, yep, but yeah, your major concern would have just been the tooth like this. Um, so yeah, just be a little bit more careful with cyclists because they are more vulnerable, aren't they? Yeah, and we don't want to be putting them in danger. Generally, when it comes to cyclists, there are three points where you shouldn't overtake. Do you know?"
where they are Corners yeah so Benz yeah bands and when you can't see the I mean oh okay you know again when you can't see yeah you can't see definitely yeah and then the last one would be um I'll be uh Junctions Junctions okay so when we're going forward and then there's a junction on the left here on the right we don't want to move on the wrong side in case someone oh okay okay yeah so three points would be on when there's a Bend because you can't see the road ahead when there's a brow Hill when you can't see the road ahead and when there are Junctions about because again the road is unpredictable right so any place if someone breaks because of you is it a serious one yeah so anything that you're doing if it's affecting other drivers and they're having to take action because of it then yes um so for example roundabouts you want to be giving priority to traffic on your right so if they're now approaching from,1912.08,1964.22,923,199,zuSzGTFMLBA,2122,https://youtu.be/zuSzGTFMLBA?t=1912,7 - Junctions present a high level of risk as they involve the possibility of moving on the wrong side and colliding with another vehicle.,"Where are corners?

So when we're going forward and then there's a junction on the left, here on the right, we don't want to move on the wrong side in case someone, oh, okay, okay, yeah. So three points would be on when there's a bend because you can't see the road ahead, when there's a brow hill when you can't see the road ahead, and when there are junctions about because again, the road is unpredictable, right? So any place if someone breaks because of you, is it a serious one? Yeah. So anything that you're doing, if it's affecting other drivers and they're having to take action because of it, then yes.

your right and now having to break for you then yeah okay okay so how was your mock test experience today are you wonderful happy experience and uh I didn't even know that it's one hour already and then I have to stop because I was thinking why you made me stop we could have gone somewhere now overall you've got a really nice drive you just need to tighten it up a little bit in like these few places that we talked about okay one is the approach speed approach speed detection take care of the bicycles whenever you look around there and uh yeah I mean up mainly the speed speed and then roundabouts that's it just making sure that you're being a bit more cautious on the lead-up to roundabouts the positioning on the roundabouts was great um the mirror checks and everything was really nice it's just the kind of the approach to it don't get there too quickly I know you're confident with third and fourth that doesn't mean you should be doing a roundabout in fourth,1966.38,2019.059,970,196,zuSzGTFMLBA,2122,https://youtu.be/zuSzGTFMLBA?t=1966,"Critical level: 5.

Then, yeah, okay. Okay, how was your mock test experience today? Are you wonderful? Happy? Experience? And, uh, I didn't even know that it's one hour already, and then I have to stop because I was thinking, ""Why did you make me stop? We could have gone somewhere."" Now, overall, you've got a really nice drive. You just need to tighten it up a little bit in these few places that we talked about. Okay, one is the approach speed, approach speed detection.

Then, you want to line up your car with that car and stop. Once you've stopped, you want to put your car in reverse, turn your wheel all the way to the right and start backing up slowly.

As you back up, you want to keep looking back and checking your mirrors to make sure that you're straight. When you see the back of the car in front of you, you want to stop and turn your wheel all the way to the left. Then, start backing up slowly again until you get close to the car behind you.

Once you're close to the car behind you, you want to turn your wheel all the way to the right and start backing up slowly into the space.

In this video, we will be going through a driving test. We will go through some of the things that you need to be aware of when you're taking your driving test. First of all, before you start your test, you should get to the location where the test is taking place at least thirty minutes before your scheduled time. This will give you enough time to get settled, calm down and to get any last-minute preparations done. 

Once you've arrived, you should make sure that you have all of the necessary documents with you. This will usually include your provisional driver's license, a proof of insurance and a document showing that your car has passed its MOT test. If you're taking your test in someone else's car, you should make sure that you have their permission to use it and that it's insured for you to drive.

When it's time for your test, the examiner will come out to meet you and they will ask you to show them your documents. They will then take you to your car and they will ask you to carry out a series of checks before the test begins. These checks will include things like checking that your brakes, lights and indicators work properly and that you've adjusted your mirrors correctly.

Once the checks have been carried out, the examiner will ask you to begin the test. The test will usually last around forty minutes and it will cover a range of different driving conditions such as town driving, country driving and motorway driving. During the test, the examiner will be looking for a range of different things, such as your ability to control your car, your awareness of road conditions and your ability to follow the rules of the road.

When the test is over, the examiner will give you your results and they will tell you whether or not you've passed. If you've passed, you'll be issued with your full driving license and you'll be free to hit the road!"
